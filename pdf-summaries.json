      "summary": "# Key Changes: Victoria Police Workplace Flexibility Policy (2021-07 to 2022-07)\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nThe 2022 update to the Workplace Flexibility policy contains minimal substantive changes. The primary modification relates to **VPS employee return-to-work arrangements** following parental leave, with a clarification of flexible working options available to them.\n\n### Major Changes\n\n**1. VPS Return to Work from Parental Leave (Section 4.4)**\n- **OLD**: VPS employees could \"request to return to work from parental leave at a reduced time-fraction until their child reaches school age, after which they will have a right to resume their pre-parental leave substantive time-fraction.\"\n- **NEW**: Same provision retained, but the policy context was updated to reflect \"changes to VPS return to work requirements\" (per the update history).\n\n**2. Policy Context Statement (Policy Section)**\n- **OLD**: Referenced \"the Victorian Government's commitment embedding flexible work in the Victorian Public Service with the starting point that all roles can have some type of flexibility\" and included specific reference to \"the three day a week default in a primary work location for full time employees.\"\n- **NEW**: Removed the explicit reference to the three-day-per-week default and VPS-specific guidance. The policy now states: \"noting the dynamic nature of the policing environment and acknowledging not all types of flexibility will work for every role.\"\n- This reflects the shift away from prescriptive VPS defaults toward more flexible, case-by-case assessment.\n\n**3. Section 6.3 Eligibility (Working from Home/Remote Work)**\n- **NEW**: Added reference to \"VPS Employees – Flexible Working Arrangements Guideline\" noting that full-time VPS employees have \"a starting point for conversations around working from home or working remotely as three days a week...from their primary work location...This is not compulsory and individual arrangements may vary.\"\n- This provision was moved from the main policy text to a supporting guideline, making it advisory rather than prescriptive.\n\n**4. Section 6.6 Application Form Language**\n- **OLD**: Referred to \"Application for Home-based-work\"\n- **NEW**: Updated reference to \"Flexible Arrangements Application Form\" to align with broader application processes.\n\n### What Changed Minimally or Not at All\n\n- All core eligibility criteria, procedures, timeframes, and decision-making frameworks remain unchanged\n- Accountabilities, dispute resolution processes, and documentation requirements are identical\n- Part-time employment provisions, flexi-time rules, and pregnancy/lactation break provisions are substantively unchanged\n- Security controls and OH&S requirements for remote/home-based work remain the same\n\n### Removed Content\n\n- The explicit mention of \"the whole of Victorian government Flexible Work Policy\" in the main policy text was removed, though references to the \"VPS Employees – Flexible Working Arrangements Guideline\" suggest this framework is still referenced\n- Removed prescriptive language about the \"three day a week default\" from the core policy, relegating it to guidance documents\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is a **minor update** focused primarily on **clarifying VPS flexible working arrangements** and reducing prescriptive language about working location defaults. The update reflects a shift toward **greater individualization** of flexible arrangements for VPS employees rather than applying a blanket three-day-per-week rule. All substantive procedural and eligibility provisions remain materially the same.",

Explicitly linking flexible work requests to operational capacity (station profiles and rostering)\n2. Recognizing pregnancy as a standalone protected circumstance (not just as parental-related)\n3. Simplifying lactation break administration while maintaining support for breastfeeding employees",
