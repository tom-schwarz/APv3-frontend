This means the organisation and its employees are obliged to take steps to prevent \ndiscriminatory practices or be haviours, not just respond to issues or complaints of discrimination \nwhen they occur. \nTo meet this requirement:  \n\u2022 As an employer, Victoria Police maintains a workplace that values the diversity and \nindividuality of its employees and encourages a workplace that is inclusive, respectful and \nfair;  \n\u2022 All Victoria Police employees and others covered by this policy statement are expected to \nexercise their positive duty by preventing discriminatory practices and encourage \nbehaviours that treat others with dignity, courtesy and respect; and  \n\u2022 Policy owners must exercise positive duty by taking the necessary steps to eliminate \nbarriers to equal opportunity when reviewing or developing systems, policy, training, \ninfrastructure and equipment in their portfolio.  \nVictoria Police provides its employees with reasonable flexibility in working arrangements where \noperational and servic e delivery priorities allow, to accommodate their family and carer \nresponsibilities, disability, religion and culture. Work unit managers are expe cted to consider and \napply these policies when managing their workplaces. \nWorkplace flexibility represents \u2018give and take\u2019 in the workplace between employer and employee for \nmutual benefit; however there must be consideration to the employee\u2019s needs, servi ce delivery, \nrostering requirements, and corporate responsibility.  It also assists in attraction and retention and \ncontributes to increased productivity and efficiency of Victoria Police. \nIn accordance with legislation and principles of merit and equity, Victoria Police applies \u2018equitable\u2019, \nrather than the \u2018same\u2019 treatment. \n  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n   \n1.

A written response to the request \n(including the reasonable business grounds if refusing an application) must be provided \nto the employee within 21 days of the employee submitting the application or vari ation to \ntheir existing arrangements. The employer must ensure that an employee\u2019s sex or family \nresponsibilities do not unfairly influence a decision to reject the employee\u2019s request.  \n\u2022 The \u2018Flexible Arrangements Checklist\u2019 exists to act as a guide for managers when \nconsidering requests for flexible work arrangements \u2013 refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource \nmanagement, Conditions of employment, Practitioner Guides and Resources\u201d. \n\u2022 Managers must consider applications carefully.  Where appropriate, they should meet and \ndiscuss an application with the employee in order to determine if an arrangement can be \nreached that is acceptable to both parties, and document all discussions held with  the \nemployee.  All relevant facts and circumstances must be considered, including:  \n- consequence for the employee of approving or not approving the arrangement; \n- effect on the workplace and the business; \n- financial impact of approving the request; \n- impact on efficiency, productivity and customer service; \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n \n   \n- ability to organise work among existing staff; \n- ability to recruit a replacement employee; \n- practicality of the arrangements which need to be put in place; \n- nature of the employee\u2019s responsibilities and role; and  \n- consequence for the workplace if flexible request is accommodated. \n\u2022 Police members only \u2013 prior to approving an application from an unconfirmed Constable \nor Recruit, consideration must be given to the above points and also to the impact on the \nemployee\u2019s training program. To do this consultation with the School of Applied Policing \nFoundation must occur to ensure that all mandatory training requirements are able to be \ncompleted in the requisite timeframes.    \n1.5 Variations \n\u2022 An employee and their manager may, by mutual agreement, vary a flexible working \narrangement as required. Variations are subject to policy and legislative requirements.   \n\u2022 Any variation to an employee\u2019s working arrangements must be documented and signed \nby both parties.  For more details about documenting arrangements, refer to each of the \nfollowing chapters for specific workplace flexibility arrangements. \n1.6 Regular review \n\u2022 The manager and the employee should review the flexible working arrangement regularly \nto ensure it still meets the genuine needs of both parties.  Workplace reviews can occur at \nany time, however it is advised that a review of the employee\u2019s part time arrangement \nshould be conducted at least every 12 months, where practicable.  Any review should be \ndocumented in accordance with the relevant policy chapter for each workplace flexibility \narrangement. \n1.7 Recording of hours of work \n\u2022 All employees must complete, maintain and submit records of attendance in accordance \nwith the requirements outlined in 302-2 Hours of work and attendance. \n1.8 Flexible working arrangements for employees returning from parental leave  \n\u2022 If a request for flexible working arrangements is granted (including by a full time \nemployee who has taken parental leave to return to work on a part time basis), this does \nnot constitute a permanent change to the employee\u2019s position with Victoria Police.  \n\u2022 If a full time employee who has returned from parental leave works on a part time basis \npursuant to a flexible working arrangement, they are entitled to return to their substantive \nfull time position once the flexible working arrangement ends, and the procedure set out \nin section 4.5 will not apply. \n  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \n   \n2. Pregnancy in the Workplace \n2.1 Overview \nVictoria Police is committed to providing and maintaining a working environment for all \npregnant employees that is safe and without risks to health.  \nSo far as is reasonably practicable, pregnant employees will be provided with the option to \nundertake alternative duties aimed at ensuring that there is minimal risk to the pregnant \nemployee, their pregnancy as well as colleagues and members of the public who require \npolice assistance.    \nPregnancy, or potential pregnancy, must not be used as a basis on which to discriminate or \nharass an employee and such employees must not be denied or limited access to \nopportunities for promotion, transfer or training or to any other benefits connected with th eir \nemployment.  \n2.2 Definitions \nRegistered Medical Practitioner: means a registered Doctor of Medicine and includes an \nObstetrician.  \n2.3 Notification and risk assessment \nOnce pregnant, some aspects of an employee\u2019s role may pose risks to the employee and their \npregnancy.  For this reason, pregnant employees are encouraged to notify their manager of \ntheir pregnancy as soon as practicable and ideally by the end of the first trimester.  At least 10 \nweeks\u2019 notice of the intention to take parental leave must be provided, including the \nproposed start and end dates and the expected date of birth of your child.  Notification \nshould include a certificate from a Registered Medical Practitioner confirming the pregnancy \nand expected due date.   \nThe manager is to ensure that the notification of pregnancy is treated confidentially and is \nrespectful of the pregnant employee.   \nEarly notification will ensure that a risk assessment can be conducted to determine \nappropriate duties during the pregnancy to avoid placing the pregnant employee or their \npregnancy at risk.  \nAn occupational health and safety risk assessment of the employee\u2019s duties will be conducted \nby the manager, in consultation with the employee, and this will be based primarily on advice \nfrom the employee\u2019s Registered Medical Practitioner. This will enable an informed decision to \nbe made on the basis of the Registered Medical Practitioner\u2019s advice regarding appropriate \nduties during the pregnancy taking into consideration identified risks in the work \nenvironment. The employee must provide the employer with a certificate from their \nRegistered Medical Practitioner using the \u2018Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and \nCertification Form\u2019 - refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Conditions of employment, \nPractitioner Guides and Resources\u201d. \nAny risk assessment must take into account the following:    \n\u2022 any potential risks to the health and safety of the pregnant employee and their \npregnancy.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \n   \n\u2022 an OHS risk assessment of the work environment.  \n\u2022 the pregnant employee\u2019s preferences and circumstances including level of expertise.  \n\u2022 Operational Safety Tactics and Training (OSTT) requirements for operational duties. \n\u2022 medical advice.   \nIt is the employee\u2019s responsibility to provide their Registered Medical Practitioner with a copy \nof the \u2018Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019 * for them to complete.  \nIn consultation with their manager, an employee will be required to complete the \u2018Workplace \nSupport Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in Touch, and Return to Work from Parental Leave\u2019 *. The plan \nis intended to support employees and their managers through the process.  \nFor further guidance on the workplace risk assessment and the \u2018Medical Information Pack and \nCertification Form\u2019 *, also refer to the \u2018Pregnancy in the Workplace and Return to Work after \nParental Leave Guide\u2019 *. \n* Refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Conditions of employment, Practitioner \nGuides and Resources\u201d. \n2.4 Duties during pregnancy \nAppropriate duties that have been determined, and as agreed between the manager and the \nemployee, must be recorded on the \u2018Workplace Support Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in Touch, and \nReturn to Work from Parental Leave\u2019 \u2013 refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, \nConditions of employment, Practitioner Guides and Resources\u201d. \nIf the work duties that have been agreed to, for the period of pregnancy, differ from the \nemployee\u2019s substantive position, the employee will continue to own and occupy their \nsubstantive position whilst performing the temporary duties. The employee will continue to \nreceive remuneration at their substantive rank/classification.  \nDuties undertaken by a pregnant employee must be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure \nthat they do not expose the employee to unnecessary risk. The employee must notify their  \nregistered medical practitioner and their manager of any developments in the pregnancy that \nmay present as a health risk so that appropriate adjustments to duties can be made.   \nRefer to section 2.5 for information on transfer to a safe job. \nHigher duties \nWhere a pregnant employee is undertaking a higher duties assignment but, due to the \npregnancy cannot perform all of the duties of that assignment, and alternative duties or \nreasonable adjustments to work responsibilities at the higher rank/classification cannot be \naccommodated, the employee will no longer be eligible for a higher duties allowance.   \nFor VPS employees, if the pregnant employee undertakes part of the duties of a higher \nclassified position, the level of the allowance shall be in proportion to the extent of the higher \nduties being performed. \nShift work \nFollowing the risk assessment, after the first trimester, the employee may be exempt from shift \nwork or night shift where, on the basis of the risk assessment, it is determined that there are \nadditional risks to the employee\u2019s safety during those shifts or, where a medical certificate \naccompanies the request.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \n \n   \nOperational Safety and Tactics Training (OSTT)/Operational and Promotional Training \nA decision regarding the completion of OSTT or other operational and promotional training \nduring pregnancy is one that the employee should only make following consideration of the \ninformation provided in the \u2018Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019, and must be \nconsistent with advice provided by their medical practitioner.  Pregnant employees wanting to \nundertake OSTT or other operational and promotion training must discuss the risks associated with \nthe training with their medical practitioner and obtain medical clearance to do so.   \nFor the avoidance of doubt, pregnant employees can be selected for promotions with a \nphysical component. This component may be completed upon the selectee\u2019s return to \noperational duties from parental leave. \n2.5 Entitlements during pregnancy \nDress for Police Members \nWhere the member\u2019s uniform can no longer be worn comfortably due to their pregnancy, the \nmember will be permitted to wear plain clothes.  \nPregnant members performing duties in plain clothes are entitled to receive a temporary \ncivilian clothing allowance. \nTransfer to a safe job  \nWhere an employee is pregnant and, in the opinion of a Registered Medical Practitioner, is fit \nfor work, but it is inadvisable for them to continue at their present work because of illness or \nrisks arising out of their pregnancy or hazards connected with the work assigned to the \nemployee, the employee will be transferred, if reasonably practicable, to an appropriate safe \njob for the risk period.    \nThe safe job may involve working from a different location, or may mean modifying the \nemployee's existing role to remove any identified risks.  This will depend on the result of the \nrisk assessment and opinion of the medical practitioner. \nThe safe job must involve meaningful duties, be commensurate with the employee\u2019s skills, \ntraining and experience. This may include bringing work from another work location within \nVictoria Police or the employee working from an alternative work location for a specific period \nor the duration of the pregnancy.  \nThe safe job will not alter the employee\u2019s terms and conditions of employment.  The \nemployee will have the same ordinary hours of work as the employee\u2019s present position; or a \ndifferent number of ordinary hours as agreed by the employee and employer.   \nWhere an employee reduces their hours to better cope with their pregnancy, any paid \nparental leave subsequently taken will be paid at the rate of pay applicable prior the reduction \nin ordinary hours.  \nIf a transfer to an appropriate safe job is not reasonably practicable, the employee may elect, \nor the employer may require the employee to commence paid no safe job leave for such \nperiod as is certified necessary by a Registered Medical Practitioner or until the end of the \npregnancy. \n2.6 Leave \nLeave, including pre-natal leave, is granted in accordance with the VPMG Parental Leave. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \n   \n3. Lactation Breaks \n3.1 Principles \nVictoria Police is committed to fostering a supportive work environment for employees who \nchoose to breastfeed by: \n\u2022 providing appropriate workplace facilities for employees who choose to express breast \nmilk or breastfeed their child; \n\u2022 providing paid lactation breaks during work hours; \n\u2022 ensuring all employees\u2019 awareness of breastfeeding policies and facilities; and  \n\u2022 seeking to eliminate any unlawful direct and/or indirect discrimination on the grounds of \nbreastfeeding. \nEmployees who choose to breastfeed should be supported in that choice and treated with \ndignity and respect in the workplace. \n3.2 Definitions \nBreastfeeding: for the purpose of this policy, this includes the physiological process of milk \nbeing produced to breastfeed or express breast milk for an infant or young child.  \nCaregiver: a caregiver is a person who assumes responsibility for bringing an infant or young \nchild onto Victoria Police premises with the intent of delivering the infant or young child to an \nemployee for the purpose of breastfeeding. \nLactation breaks: paid breaks taken by an employee in consultation with their employer for \nthe sole purpose of enabling an employee to express breast milk or breastfeed an infant or \nyoung child off site or at the workplace. \nYoung child: generally up to two years of age, however consideration should be given to \nemployee\u2019s individual circumstances and needs. \n3.3 Breastfeeding facilities \nWorkplace facilities should be provided, where practicable, for employees who choose to \nexpress breast milk or breastfeed their child during work hours. \nThe minimum requirements for an appropriate workplace facility include, where practicable:  \n\u2022 a private, clean and hygienic space which is suitably signed and lockable, \n\u2022 appropriate seating, a table or bench to support breastfeeding (and breastfeeding \nequipment), \n\u2022 a power point for breast pumps and other equipment, \n\u2022 access in the workplace, to a refrigerator/freezer for storing milk and a microwave, \n\u2022 access to a sink with hot water for washing hands and equipment, \n\u2022 nappy change table, and \n\u2022 an appropriate receptacle for rubbish and nappy disposal.   \nIt is not appropriate for employees to breastfeed or express breast milk in toilet facilities, nor \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \n \n   \nis it an appropriate location for equipment to be cleaned.  Sinks and refrigeration located in a \nstaffroom or kitchen facility should be used.  The employee should refrigerate milk in milk \ncollection containers that are clearly labelled with the employee's name and date and placed \ninto a separate opaque named lidded container such as a lunch box within the communal \nrefrigerator/freezer. \nGenerally, workplace facilities should be used, however consideration should be given to \nallowing the employee to go home, to a caregivers home or accessing a child care centre if \nrequested.  Requests should be assessed on a case by case basis. \n3.4 Lactation breaks \nThe frequency, duration and timing of lactation breaks: \n\u2022 should be determined through consultation between the employee and their manager to \nallow the flexibility needed to breastfeed or express milk. \n\u2022 will vary between individuals and may be influenced by factors including the child\u2019s age, \nfeeding habits, the location of the breastfeeding room and any special requirements.  \n\u2022 should normally reduce over time and become easier to schedule around operational \nneeds.  Generally they should be no more than 30 minutes in duration, and be taken no \nmore than twice per 8 hour shift.  However the employee\u2019s individual circumstances and \nneeds should be taken into consideration.  Employees working greater shift lengths will \nbe provided, where required, with an additional break of up to 30 minutes.  The needs of \nemployees working less than 8 hours will be assessed on a case by case basis according to \ntheir circumstances. \n\u2022 are to be documented in a \u2018Lactation Breaks Plan\u2019, which should be reviewed on a regular \nbasis \u2013 refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Conditions of employment, \nPractitioner Guides and Resources\u201d.  A copy of the agreement should be retained by each \nparty. \n\u2022 should be timed to take into account reasonable business and organisational needs with a \nfocus on minimising disruption to the workplace and service delivery.

Where appropriate, they should meet and \ndiscuss an application with the employee in order to determine if an arrangement can be \nreached that is acceptable to both parties, and document all discussions held with the \nemployee.  All relevant facts and circumstances must be considered when determining \nwhether to approve part time arrangements, including:  \n\u2022 the applicants circumstances, including the nature of their responsibilities as a parent or \ncarer; \n\u2022 consequence for the employee of approving or not approving the arrangement; \n\u2022 consequence for the workplace if the part time arrangement is accommodated i.e. \nfinancial impact of approving the request; impact on efficiency, productivity and customer \nservice; ability to organise work among existing staff; ability to recruit a replacement \nemployee; practicality of the arrangements which need to be put in place; and nature of \nthe role that is being offered. \nWhen considering an application for a part time arrangement or an application to alter a part \ntime arrangement made in accordance with the Fair Work Act 2009, the employer must \ncomplete the 'Flexible Arrangements Checklist' \u2013 refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource \nmanagement, Conditions of employment, Practitioner Guides and Resources\u201d.  A copy of the \ncompleted \u2018Application for a Part Time Arrangement/Application to Vary Existing Part Time \nArrangement\u2019 must be placed on the employee\u2019s personnel file.  \nWork pattern  \nPolice Members: Hours of work for part time members can be structured in a number of different \nways including:  \n\u2022 set start and finishing times on each day; and/or \n\u2022 a number of hours and days over a specified period. \nPart time arrangements can include a written agreement that provides for an agreed number \nof hours and days to be worked flexibly. This means that a process can be included in a part \ntime arrangement, which sets out parameters for any alteration to the pattern of the hours on \na fortnightly basis, with a view to meeting the employee\u2019s work/life balance and taking into \naccount the operational requirements of the employer. Any such provision must be recorded \nin an \u2018Application for a Part Time Arrangement/Application to Vary Existing Part Time \nArrangement\u2019 - access through HR Assist, Employee Self Service, Status Change. \nThe pattern of hours of a part time member may vary from the standard roster at a work area \nonly with the agreement of the employer.  \nWhile the minimum shift duration is four hours, where possible the shift length should be the \nsame as the shift length at the station to which the member is attached.  However, a shorter \nor longer shift length can be agreed if it suits the needs of the member and the workplace.   \nFor a part time member who is entitled to receive the commuted overtime allowance, \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \n \n   \nmanagement must not approve shifts that are longer than eight hours.     \nVPS Employees: Hours of work must include an agreed number of hours and days over a \nspecified period.  \nUnless the employee is a shift worker, part time hours of work must be rostered within the \nordinary span of hours of 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday.  An exception to this is if an \nemployee and their employer enter into an individual flexibility arrangement to meet the \ngenuine needs of both parties.  Such an individual flexibility arrangement that includes hours \nof work outside of the ordinary span of hours must be in writing and signed by both the \nemployee and their employer (the delegate for approval of the individual flexibility \narrangement is the Director, Workplace Relations, Human Resource Department).  \nEmployees must not work less than three consecutive hours on a work day, except in \nexceptional circumstances by agreement with the employer.  \nVariations to part time arrangements  \nThe employer and employee are encouraged to regularly review agreed part time \narrangements to assess whether the arrangement continues to meet the needs of both \nparties.  If an employee changes their work location, a new part time application form must be \nsubmitted.  \nWorkplace reviews can occur at any time, however it is advised that a review of the \nemployee\u2019s part time arrangement should be conducted at least every 12 months, wh ere \npracticable.  Any review should be documented. \nAny review of a part time arrangement should have regard to the individual circumstances of \nthe employee, including, where relevant, the child-care requirements of that employee. \nReviews of part time arrangements must also take into account any requirements contained in \nthe Fair Work Act 2009, the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 and the criteria stipulated in section \n4.5.   \nPart time working arrangements may be varied by written agreement between the employee \nand the employer by completing and submitting an \u2018Application for a Part Time \nArrangement/Application to Vary Existing Part Time Arrangement\u2019 \u2013 apply through HR Assist, \nEmployee Self Service, Status Change. \nTemporary variations to agreed/rostered hours of duty of part time employees may occur at \nany time by prior mutual agreement between the employee and the employer.  \nPolice Members: Where the employer proposes to vary an existing arrangement and \nagreement cannot be reached, the employer may, upon the provision of six months\u2019 notice or \na longer period as is reasonable having regard to the employee\u2019s personal circumstances, vary \nthe employee\u2019s pattern of hours.  \nDirected shift changes \nDirected changes to shifts of part time employees should only be considered in exceptional \noperational circumstances including when no other alternatives are available. The employer is \nto take into account an employee\u2019s individual circumstances before directing a temporary \nchange to the shifts of a part time employee.  \nWhere a directed change has occurred, overtime payments will apply in accordance with the \nenterprise bargaining agreements. \nIn certain circumstances where the employer has directed a change to an employee\u2019s shift, the \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \n \n   \nemployer may be required to pay child care expenses. Child care expenses apply for VPS \nemployees as per clause 39 of the Victorian Public Service Enterprise Agreement 2016 and for \npolice members as per clause 164 of the Victoria Police (Police Officers (excluding \nCommanders), Protective Services Officers, Police Reservists and Police Recruits) Enterprise \nAgreement 2015.  \nPolice Members: Where the member\u2019s rostered shift is changed without the member\u2019s \nconsent and 48 hours or less notice is given, the change of shift penalty will apply under \nclause 36 of the Victoria Police (Police Officers (excluding Commanders), Protective Services \nOfficers, Police Reservists and Police Recruits) Enterprise Agreement 2015.  \nOvertime payments and the change of shift penalty cannot apply for the same period of time \nand the member will be entitled to the higher penalty payable at any given time.  \nPart time police members should not normally be required to be available for resumption of \nduty unless included in the \u2018Application for a Part Time Arrangement/Application to Vary \nExisting Part Time Arrangement\u2019 form.  Where part time members continue to be available for \nresumption of duty, payment is to be made in accordance with the Victoria Police (Police \nOfficers (excluding Commanders), Protective Services Officers, Police Reservists and Police \nRecruits) Enterprise Agreement 2015.  \nVPS Employees: The employer may only direct a change where an emergency exists and \nthere are no other alternatives.  \nOvertime applies if the directed change is outside the normal span of hours of 7am to 7p m \nMonday to Friday or the employee works more than 38 hours per week.  \nReturn to full time employment \nA part time employee may revert to full time employment at any time, providing that an \nequivalent full time vacancy or sufficient residual hours exist; however, this is subject to \nsection 1.8 \u2013 Flexible working arrangements for employees returning from parental leave.   \nTime in position requirements do not apply to either promotion or transfer to a full time \nposition.  \nAn employee owning two part time positions may make the request to convert to full time in \neither of their existing positions, however if approved, would need to vacate their remaining \npart time position as they cannot work more than full time hours.  \nAny requests are to be considered in the context of service delivery needs and are subject to \navailability of sufficient residual hours. At management discretion, hours available within the \nPolice Service Area, Division, Region, Command or Department, in which the employee is \nlocated may be utilised.  \nEmployees may elect to accept a lesser rank/classification, and/or different duties in order to \nreturn to full time employment.   \n4.6 Conditions of employment \nPart time employees have, on a pro rata basis, the same terms and conditions as full time \nemployees.  \nAllowances  \nPolice members: are entitled to pro rata amounts for the uniform and civilian clothing \nallowances and commuted overtime allowance.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \n \n   \nLeave  \nWorking part-time will impact the payment of long service leave - refer to the VPMP Long \nService Leave \u2013 refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Conditions of employment\u201d.   \nAccrual of recreation and personal and carers leave will be on a pro-rata basis. \nPolice members who work part-time (including those who own/occupy multiple part-time \npositions) are not eligible for accrued time off.   \nOvertime  \nAn employee may be required to work reasonable overtime in accordance with the provisions \nof the Victoria Police (Police Officers (excluding Commanders), Protective Services Officers, \nPolice Reservists and Police Recruits) Enterprise Agreement 2015 and the Victorian Public \nService Enterprise Agreement 2016.  \nPolice Members: Overtime will be paid for hours worked outside the ordinary hours specified \nin the member\u2019s Part Time Agreement at the rates contained in Part 6 of the Victoria Police \n(Police Officers (excluding Commanders), Protective Services Officers, Police Reservists and \nPolice Recruits) Enterprise Agreement 2015; or the member may elect to take time off in lieu \nunder Part 8 of the Victoria Police (Police Officers (excluding Commanders), Protective \nServices Officers, Police Reservists and Police Recruits) Enterprise Agreement 2015. This \nprovision also applies for any attendance at training.    \nA part time member, who is in receipt of the commuted overtime allowance, must not be \nrostered to work more than eight hours in any one shift.  \nVPS Employees: Other than shift workers, additional hours up to and including 38 hours per \nweek will be paid at the ordinary hourly rate of pay. Hours directed by the employer and in \nexcess of 38 hours per week will be paid at the overtime rates specified in the Victorian Public \nService Enterprise Agreement 2016. \nAssignments and temporary duties  \nVictoria Police\u2019s recruitment, allocation, assignment, transfer and promotion processes are \nconducted in a manner that provides fair and equitable opportunity to all employees.  \nPart time employees may be assigned to other positions or duties, either full time or part time, \nin accordance with the Assignment process. Part time employees should be considered for \nassignment opportunities in the same way as full time employees.  \nWhere the assignment is \u2018directed\u2019, the employee\u2019s existing working pattern remains unless \notherwise agreed.  \nWhere a part time employee applies for an assignment with full time, or increased hours to \ntheir normal working pattern, a part time application will need to be submitted to cover the \nassignment period.  If it is agreed that the part time hours can be worked, the working pattern \narrangement for the higher duties period should be documented and signed by both parties.  \nWhere a part time police member is assigned to a part time position, or to a full time position \non a part time basis, they may, by request and with the agreement of the employer, continue \nto perform the duties of their own position while assigned to another position, as long as their \nsum of rostered hours does not exceed 76 hours per fortnight.  A part time working pattern \nagreement for the assignment position should be documented and signed by both parties.   \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \n \n   \nSurplus employees \nIf a part time position is abolished, the employee is declared surplus and is placed under the \nprovisions of 306-11 Redeployment or VPMG Mobility and redeployment (sworn employees) \nPolicy.  Where a part time position is not available, surplus staff will be matched to \nappropriate full time positions in consultation with the employee. The employee may apply \nfor the position, to which they are matched, to be converted to part time in accordance with \nsection 4.5 above.   \nSuperannuation \nPart time employment has implications for superannuation. Employees should seek \nsuperannuation advice from their fund before finalising their part time arrangements.  \nAttendance at Training \nAlternative methods of delivery of training will be considered to maximise opportunities for all \nemployees to access training.   \n4.7 Owning/Occupying two part time positions \nAn employee may own/occupy two part time positions at the same level/rank, and at the \nsame or different locations, provided that the sum of hours per fortnight does not exceed 76 \nhours per fortnight. Employees who own/occupy two part time positions must ensure that the \nhours for each position are compatible. The member must communicate with each authorised \ndelegate separately concerning any changes that may impact on either position. This includes \nthe impact of attendance at training.    \nWhen making decisions in relation to one of the positions the employee occupies, the \nauthorised delegate must consult with the authorised delegate of the other position occupied \nby the employee.  \nExamples of the types of decisions that authorised delegates should consult over are: a \ndirection to work overtime (to ensure that hours of both positions are taken into \nconsideration); approval of assignment or higher duties; the requirement to undertake \ncompulsory training.     \nTime in position \u2013 Police Members \nWhen a police member occupies two part time positions, time in position dates are the dates \nfor each individual position.  \nRate of pay \nThe employee shall receive all salaries, entitlements and allowances on a pro-rata basis for the \ntotal number of hours worked in both positions.  \nPromotion or reversion \u2013 Police Members \nWhen the member\u2019s rank changes (promotion or reversion) the member will be unattached \nfrom all positions at the previous rank.  \nWorkCover  \nWorkCover responsibilities are to be managed by the workplace in which the injury occurred.   \nIf it is not known when or where the injury occurred (eg: injury occurring over a period of \ntime), then the claim should be managed by the workplace where the claim was lodged.  \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \n \n   \nRelinquishing a position  \nThe employee may vacate one of the owned positions at any time in order to revert to owning \nonly one part time position. Where this occurs for police members, the member must not \napply for an additional part time position which involves the same hours as the relinquished \nposition until the balance of the time in position requirements of the relinquished position \nhave been met.   \n  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \n \n   \n5. Flexi Time (VPS Employees only) \n5.1 Purpose \nVictoria Police is committed to providing flexibility in the workplace that takes into account \nthe work requirements of the organisation and the personal/family circumstances of the \nemployee.  \n5.2 Flexi time \nAn employee can work and accumulate flexi time by agreement between the employer and \nemployee: \n\u2022 where the Manager is satisfied that there is sufficient work to be performed; and  \n\u2022 where required, a sufficient level of supervision is available.  \nFlexi time must be negotiated within the normal span of hours between 7:00am and 7:00pm, \nMonday to Friday. Unless the employee and their manager have entered into an individual \nflexibility arrangement (IFA), any work performed outside of these hours is considered to be \novertime.  If entering into an IFA, contact the Workplace Relations Division. \nFlexi time is not generally available to sworn employees, shift workers, causal employees or \nVPSG-5 and above (and Forensic Officer equivalent), particularly those in management or \nsupervisory roles where business continuity would be adversely affected by flexi time \narrangements. In exceptional circumstances however, an individual arrangement may be \nreached between the parties.  \nWhere it is determined that the accrual of flexi time no longer meets the needs of the work \nunit, the Manager is required to consult with the relevant employees and the relevant union in \naccordance with the \u2018Implementation of change\u2019 provisions of the VPS Enterprise Agreement.  \n5.3 Flexi credit \nUnless exceptional circumstances exist, and approval is provided by the Manager to carry a \ngreater accrual, the maximum amount of flexi time credit allowed for a full time employee is \n15.2 hours, and for a part time employee is the equivalent of two days of their part time work \npattern.  \nWhere an employee has flexi time credit in excess of the allowable limit, the Manager may \ndirect the employee to take the excess hours, unless the flexi time credit is to cover a \nChristmas Closedown period in accordance with Section 1.4 of the Hours of Duty and \nAttendance Policy.  \nWhere an employee does not use all of their flexi credit prior to the cessation of their \nemployment with Victoria Police, they will be entitled to have any outstanding credits paid out \nto them at their ordinary hourly rate of pay.  \n5.4 Flexi debit \nIn exceptional circumstances, an employee may take flexi time without the necessary flexi \ncredit being accrued. This can only occur with prior approval from the Manager and must not \nresult in a full time employee having a negative balance that exceeds \u2013 7.6 (negative) hours \nfor a full time employee or that exceeds -1 (negative) day for a part time employee. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \n \n   \nIf an employee has an excess flexi debit and does not reduce the debit within a reasonable \nperiod as specified by the Manager, the employee must elect to utilise either recreation leave \nor leave without pay to recoup the debit.  \nWhere an employee has a flexi debt on cessation of employment, money or leave owed by the \nemployee to the employer will be debited accordingly, at their ordinary hourly rate of pay in \naccordance with the Financial Management Act 1994 (Vic), except where the cessation is due \nto death.   \n5.5 Taking flexi time \nFlexi time must only be taken with prior approval from the Employee\u2019s Manager. In making \nany assessment as to when flexi time can be taken, the Manager will give full consideration to \nthe employee\u2019s preferences; however, it may not always be possible for the employee to take \nflexi time on their nominated day due to the service delivery requirements of the work unit.  \nFlexi time should be taken as a full or half day based on the employee\u2019s ordinary hours of \nwork. At the discretion of the Manager, approval may be given to an employee to take flexi \nleave in hours.  \n5.6 Christmas closedown \nWhere a Work Unit Manager intends to closedown part or all of the unit\u2019s operatio ns for the \nperiod from the first working day after Christmas Day to the first working day after New Year\u2019s \nDay (closedown period), the Work Unit Manager: \n\u2022 will notify relevant employees  in writing of this intention no later than 1 October of the \nyear in which the closedown is to take place; \n\u2022 will request relevant employees to utilise any accrued time in lieu, annual leave, substitute \nleave, flexi time credits or additional hours accrued under a flexible working arrangement; \nand \n\u2022 may require a minimum level of staffing to meet the operational requirements of the \nworkplace. \nIf there are insufficient expressions of interest from relevant employees to give effect to the \nclosedown period, the following process will be applied: \n\u2022 the Work Unit Manager may direct an employee who has excessive recreation leave (more \nthan eight weeks or two years accruals), to take recreation leave during the closedown \nperiod; \n\u2022 the Work Unit Manager may then direct an employee with accrued time in lieu, flexi time \ncredits or substitute leave to take that leave during the closedown period. \nThe Work Unit Manager will provide at least four weeks\u2019 notice of any direction to take leave.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n \n   \n6. Working from Home \n6.1 Overview \nVictoria Police aims to provide employment options to maximise workforce flexibili ty, and \npromote a balance between optimal service delivery and employees\u2019 personal commitments.  \n\u2022 Victoria Police will be fair and transparent in considering requests by employees to work \nfrom home. \n\u2022 Employees granted approval to work from home will continue to be provided with equal \nopportunities in their employment. \n\u2022 Individual working from home arrangements may be permitted on a short-term basis and \nwill be assessed regularly, having regard to both employees\u2019 personal responsibilities and \norganisational needs. \n\u2022 Employees are not to undertake work at home unless they have obtained approval in \naccordance with this guideline. \n6.2 Definitions \nHome Based Work (HBW) Location: the area designated by the employee within their home \nas the work location in which they will perform their home based work.  This includes areas \nthe employee accesses in their home when taking breaks; such as the kitchen, bathroom, \npassageways and staircases. \nHome Based Work (HBW) Arrangement: a flexible work arrangement that may be \nauthorised on a short term basis to help accommodate employees\u2019 occasional and \nintermittent personal commitments, and emergencies.   \nCarer: means a person, including a person under the age of 18 years, who provides care to \nanother person with whom he or she is in a care relationship.  \nCare relationship: a person is in a care relationship if they provide care to another person \nbecause they have a disability, are older, have a mental illness, or an ongoing medical \ncondition (including a terminal or chronic illness or dementia); or has care of a child under a \npermanent care order, child care agreement or protection order.  \nParent: includes parent, step-parent, adoptive parent, foster parent, guardian, or the spouse \nor domestic partner of a parent. \n6.3 Eligibility \nAll employees other than recruits, probationary constables and VPS employees who are within \ntheir probationary period are eligible to apply to work from home.

This includes maintaining the confidentiality, \nintegrity and availability of Victoria Police information. \n\u2022 To ensure the security of Victoria Police information, Authorised Users who are not \nVictoria Police employees are not to undertake work at home. \nRisks \nWorking from home increases a number of security risks for Victoria Police information \nincluding (but not limited to): \n\u2022 the potential for people without a \u2018need-to-know\u2019 or without an appropriate security \nclearance to gain access to (or read) official information or other official resources  \n\u2022 loss of Victoria Police information in transit between the workplace and home \n\u2022 viruses or other malicious code being present or being introduced to IT equipment.  \nSecurity classified information \n\u2022 Information that has been assessed as PROTECTED or above is not to be worked on using \nhome based computer equipment, unless this is done on the Victoria Police network \nthrough approved secure two-factor authentication (such as Connect.Police tokens).  \nRefer to Information categorisation, collection and recording Policy for information on \nsecurity classifications. \n\u2022 Hardcopy security classified information must be stored in a container suitable for the \nclassification of the material when not in use.  Refer to IMSSD guide \u2013 G200 \u2013 Assessment \nand handling of Victoria Police Information.  If a suitable security container is not \navailable, then the information should not be taken home. \n\u2022 Any deviation from these requirements requires approval by the Department Head after \nseeking advice from the Information Security Manager and the Protective Security \nManager, Information Management, Standards & Security Division. \n6.5 Occupational Health & Safety \nVictoria Police will provide and maintain, so far as is reasonably practicable, workplaces and \nworking environments that are safe and without risks to health for all employees and \nindividuals using Victoria Police premises, facilities or equipment.  This applies to an approved \nHome Based Work Location. \nEmployees granted approval to work from home must comply with their obligations under the \nVictorian Occupational Health and Safety Act and all relevant Victoria Police occupational \nhealth and safety policies and procedures, and take corrective action to eliminate all potential \nhazards within their Home Based Work Location.  Any hazards which cannot be immediately \ncorrected must be reported.  \nEmployees will be required to comply with all reasonable and lawful directions by Victoria \nPolice from time to time, including directions regarding safe work methods which may require \nemployees to rearrange or alter the Home Based Work Location. \nEmployees must report all work related health and safety concerns or incidents that occur at \ntheir Home Based Work Location to Victoria Police as soon as is reasonably practicable. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \n \n   \n6.6 Applying \nApplication form \nEmployees applying for a Home Based Work Arrangement must complete an \u2018Application for \nHome Based Work\u2019 (including an OH&S Self-Assessment Checklist for their Home Based Work \nLocation) and submit it to their line manager for consideration.  Applications will be assessed \non a case by case basis and approval is at the discretion of management.   \nAccountability for considering Home Based Work applications remains with the approvi ng \nlocation with final signoff required by Workplace Relations Division, Human Resource \nDepartment. \nEmployee responsibilities \nIn all cases where an employee submits a request to work from home, consultation must \noccur between the employee and their manager.  It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to ensure \nthat:  \n\u2022 their manager receives their written request in a timely manner; \n\u2022 they complete required forms and supply any supporting documentation to provide their \nmanager with sufficient information to reasonably consider their request; and \n\u2022 any changes in circumstances for the application are advised to their manager as soon as \npossible. \nManager responsibilities \nIn considering requests by employees to work from home, the manager must take into \naccount any relevant factors before providing the employee with a final decision.  These may \ninclude: \n\u2022 compliance with all applicable legislation; \n\u2022 the nature of the responsibilities of the employee\u2019s position including supervision of other \nemployees, service response to other employees or the public, whether the employee \nrequires regular access to hard copy information and/or has access to sensitive or \nprotectively marked information; \n\u2022 the employee is fit for work.  Working from home is not a substitute for personal leave;  \n\u2022 whether the security risk of accessing Victoria Police information to enable an employee \nto work from home is too significant (refer to section 6.8 for more detailed information); \n\u2022 any security arrangements that an employee will need to comply with to enable a H ome \nBased Work arrangement to be approved; \n\u2022 the employee\u2019s personal circumstances and the reason(s) underlying their request to work \nfrom home.  NOTE: The Equal Opportunity Act 2010 provides a general right to parents \nand carers to have their caring responsibilities reasonably accommodated.  The Act \nprovides that the employer must not unreasonably refuse to accommodate those \nresponsibilities.  The Fair Work Act 2009 provides that employees can request flexible \nworking arrangements if an employee:  \n- is a parent or carer of a child who is of school age or younger;  \n- is a carer within the meaning of the Carer Recognition Act 2010;  \n- has a disability;  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \n \n   \n- is 55 years or older;  \n- is experiencing violence from a member of their immediate family; or  \n- is providing support to a member of the employee's immediate family or household \nwho is experiencing violence.  \nAny application to work from home or variation submitted for the purpose of carer \nresponsibilities can only be refused on reasonable business grounds.  A written resp onse to \nthe request must be provided to the employee within 21 days of the employee submitting the \napplication or variation to their existing arrangements.  It should however be noted that \nemployees working from home should not be concurrently caring for a person/child while \nperforming their work hours.  For further information, refer to Flexible Work.   \nThe following will be taken into account in considering the Home Based Work application : \n\u2022 the ability of the employee to complete their home based work within their ordinary \nhours of work; \n\u2022 the effect (if any) on the employee\u2019s work unit; \n\u2022 the ability to successfully delegate work to an employee who is working from home;  \n\u2022 whether an employee who is working from home can be properly supervised and their \nwork properly assessed; \n\u2022 an employee\u2019s ability to work autonomously i.e. an employee who requires close \nsupervision or constant interaction with other staff may not be suitable for the \nindependent environment of home based work with minimal supervision; \n\u2022 details provided by the employee in their OH&S Self-Assessment Checklist \u2013 refer to VPM, \n\u201cHuman resource management, Conditions of employment\u201d; \n\u2022 evidence that the employee will be able to work in a room or area secluded from other \nparts of the home; and \n\u2022 equipment and resources necessary for the employee to effectively work from home. \nAdditional factors for employees and managers \nAdditional factors for employees and managers to think about when considering applications \nfor a Home Based Work Arrangement include: \n\u2022 Appropriate security measures that must be applied to Victoria Police equipment and \ninformation when it is in transit to and from a Home Based Work Location and being \nused, stored away or disposed of (refer to section 6.8 for more detailed information); \n\u2022 In accordance with VPMP Information and Information Equipment Disposal, any \nequipment (including personally owned equipment) that has been used to collect or store \nofficial information must be cleansed of all data or destroyed in accordance with VPMP \nInformation Review, Retention and Disposal when:  \n- it has reached the end of its useful life  \n- prior to being sold or given to a third party; \n\u2022 For police members \n- Approved working from home arrangements will only be from Monday to Friday \nbetween the hours of 7.00am to 5.00pm.

Pregnancy in the Workplace \n2.1 Overview \nVictoria Police is committed to providing and maintaining a working environment for all \npregnant employees that is safe and without risks to health.  \nSo far as is reasonably practicable, pregnant employees will be provided with the option to \nundertake alternative duties aimed at ensuring that there is minimal risk to the pregnant \nemployee, their pregnancy as well as colleagues and members of the public who require \npolice assistance.    \nPregnancy, or potential pregnancy, must not be used as a basis on which to discriminate or \nharass an employee and such employees must not be denied or limited access to \nopportunities for promotion, transfer or training or to any other benefits connected with their \nemployment.  \n2.2 Definitions \nRegistered Medical Practitioner: means a registered Doctor of Medicine and includes an \nObstetrician.  \n2.3 Notification and risk assessment \nOnce pregnant, some aspects of an employee\u2019s role may pose risks to the employee and their \npregnancy.  For this reason, pregnant employees are encouraged to notify their manager of \ntheir pregnancy as soon as practicable, taking into consideration that some roles will pose \nhigher health and safety risks to the employee and their pregnancy than others.  At least 10 \nweeks\u2019 notice of the intention to take parental leave must be provided, including the \nproposed start and end dates and the expected date of birth of your child.  Notification \nshould include a certificate from a Registered Medical Practitioner confirming the  pregnancy \nand expected due date.   \nThe manager is to ensure that the notification of pregnancy is treated confidentially and is \nrespectful of the pregnant employee.   \nEarly notification will ensure that a risk assessment can be conducted to determine \nappropriate duties during the pregnancy to avoid placing the pregnant employee or their \npregnancy at risk.  \nAn occupational health and safety risk assessment of the employee\u2019s duties will be conducted \nby the manager, in consultation with the employee, and this will be based primarily on advice \nfrom the employee\u2019s Registered Medical Practitioner. This will enable an informed decision to \nbe made on the basis of the Registered Medical Practitioner\u2019s advice regarding appropriate \nduties during the pregnancy taking into consideration identified risks in the work \nenvironment. The employee must provide the employer with a certificate from their \nRegistered Medical Practitioner using the \u2018Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and \nCertification Form\u2019 - refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Conditions of employment, \nPractitioner Guides and Resources\u201d. \nAny risk assessment must take into account the following:    \n\u2022 any potential risks to the health and safety of the pregnant employee and their pregnancy \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \n\u2022 an OHS risk assessment of the work environment \n\u2022 the pregnant employee\u2019s preferences and circumstances including level of expertise \n\u2022 Operational Safety Tactics and Training (OSTT) requirements for operational duties \n\u2022 medical advice.   \nIt is the employee\u2019s responsibility to provide their Registered Medical Practitioner with a copy \nof the \u2018Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019 for them to complete.  \nIn consultation with their manager, an employee will be required to complete the \u2018Workplace \nSupport Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in Touch, and Return to Work from Parental Leave\u2019. The plan is \nintended to support employees and their managers through the process.  \nFor further guidance on the workplace risk assessment and the \u2018Medical Information Pack and \nCertification Form\u2019, also refer to the \u2018Pregnancy in the Workplace and Return to Work after \nParental Leave Guide\u2019. \nRefer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Conditions of employment, Practitioner Guides \nand Resources\u201d. \n2.4 Duties during pregnancy \nAppropriate duties that have been determined, and as agreed between the manager and the \nemployee, must be recorded on the \u2018Workplace Support Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in Touch, and \nReturn to Work from Parental Leave\u2019 \u2013 refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, \nConditions of employment, Practitioner Guides and Resources\u201d. \nIf the work duties that have been agreed to, for the period of pregnancy, differ from the \nemployee\u2019s substantive position, the employee will continue to own and occupy their \nsubstantive position whilst performing the temporary duties. The employee will continue to \nreceive remuneration at their substantive rank/classification.  \nDuties undertaken by a pregnant employee must be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure \nthat they do not expose the employee to unnecessary risk. The employee must notify their \nregistered medical practitioner and their manager of any developments in the pregnancy that \nmay present as a health risk so that appropriate adjustments to duties can be made.   \nRefer to section 2.5 for information on transfer to a safe job. \nHigher duties \nWhere a pregnant employee is undertaking a higher duties assignment but, due to the \npregnancy cannot perform all of the duties of that assignment, and alternative duties or \nreasonable adjustments to work responsibilities at the higher rank/classification c annot be \naccommodated, the employee will no longer be eligible for a higher duties allowance.   \nFor VPS employees, if the pregnant employee undertakes part of the duties of a higher \nclassified position, the level of the allowance shall be in proportion to the extent of the higher \nduties being performed. \nShift work \nFollowing the risk assessment, after the first trimester, the employee may be exempt from shift \nwork or night shift where, on the basis of the risk assessment, it is determined that there are \nadditional risks to the employee\u2019s safety during those shifts or, where a medical certificate \naccompanies the request.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \nOperational Safety and Tactics Training (OSTT)/Operational and Promotional Training \nA decision regarding the completion of OSTT or other operational and promotional training \nduring pregnancy is one that the employee should only make following consideration of the \ninformation provided in the \u2018Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019, and must be \nconsistent with advice provided by their medical practitioner.  Pregnant employees wanting to \nundertake OSTT or other operational and promotion training must discuss the risks associated \nwith the training with their medical practitioner and obtain medical clearance to do so.   \nFor the avoidance of doubt, pregnant employees can be selected for promotions with a \nphysical component. This component may be completed upon the selectee\u2019s return to \noperational duties from parental leave. \n2.5 Entitlements during pregnancy \nDress for Police Members \nWhere the member\u2019s uniform can no longer be worn comfortably due to their pregnancy, the \nmember will be permitted to wear plain clothes.  \nPregnant members performing duties in plain clothes are entitled to receive a temporary \ncivilian clothing allowance. \nTransfer to a safe job  \nWhere an employee is pregnant and, in the opinion of a Registered Medical Practitioner, is fit \nfor work, but it is inadvisable for them to continue at their present work because of illness or \nrisks arising out of their pregnancy or hazards connected with the work assigned to the \nemployee, the employee will be transferred, if reasonably practicable, to an appropriate safe \njob for the risk period.    \nThe safe job may involve working from a different location, or may mean modifying the \nemployee's existing role to remove any identified risks.  This will depend on the result of the \nrisk assessment and opinion of the medical practitioner. \nThe safe job must involve meaningful duties, be commensurate with the employee\u2019s skills, \ntraining and experience. This may include bringing work from another work location within \nVictoria Police or the employee working from an alternative work location for a specific period \nor the duration of the pregnancy.  \nThe safe job will not alter the employee\u2019s terms and conditions of employment.  The \nemployee will have the same ordinary hours of work as the employee\u2019s present position; or a \ndifferent number of ordinary hours as agreed by the employee and employer.   \nWhere an employee reduces their hours to better cope with their pregnancy, any paid \nparental leave subsequently taken will be paid at the rate of pay applicable prior the reduction \nin ordinary hours.  \nIf a transfer to an appropriate safe job is not reasonably practicable, the employee may elect, \nor the employer may require the employee to commence paid no safe job leave for such \nperiod as is certified necessary by a Registered Medical Practitioner or until the end of the \npregnancy. \n2.6 Leave \nLeave, including pre-natal leave, is granted in accordance with the VPMG Parental Leave. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \n3.

Requests should be assessed on a case by case basis. \n3.4 Lactation breaks \nThe frequency, duration and timing of lactation breaks: \n\u2022 should be determined through consultation between the employee and their manager to \nallow the flexibility needed to breastfeed or express milk \n\u2022 will vary between individuals and may be influenced by factors including the child\u2019s age, \nfeeding habits, the location of the breastfeeding room and any special requirements \n\u2022 should normally reduce over time and become easier to schedule around operational \nneeds.  Generally they should be no more than 30 minutes in duration, and be taken no \nmore than twice per 8 hour shift.  However the employee\u2019s individual circumstances and \nneeds should be taken into consideration.  Employees working greater shift lengths will \nbe provided, where required, with an additional break of up to 30 minutes.  The needs of \nemployees working less than 8 hours will be assessed on a case by case basis according to \ntheir circumstances \n\u2022 are to be documented in a \u2018Lactation Breaks Plan\u2019, which should be reviewed on a regular \nbasis \u2013 refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Conditions of employment, \nPractitioner Guides and Resources\u201d.  A copy of the agreement should be retained by each \nparty \n\u2022 should be timed to take into account reasonable business and organisational needs with a \nfocus on minimising disruption to the workplace and service delivery.  If, in emergency \nsituations, there is a need to delay the taking of a lactation break, efforts should be made \nto ensure that the employee is able to take the break as soon as practicable in order to \nminimise any risks to the employee\u2019s health or milk supply or the child\u2019s health  \n\u2022 where the child or infant is breastfed offsite, the breastfeeding break is inclusive of the \ntime needed to travel directly to and from the agreed location.

This means that a process can be included in a part \ntime arrangement, which sets out parameters for any alteration to the pattern of the hours on \na fortnightly basis, with a view to meeting the employee\u2019s work/life balance and taking into \naccount the operational requirements of the employer. Any such provision must be recorded \nin an \u2018Application for a Part Time Arrangement/Application to Vary Existing Part Time \nArrangement\u2019 - access through HR Assist, Employee Self Service, Status Change. \nThe pattern of hours of a part time member may vary from the standard roster at a work area \nonly with the agreement of the employer.  \nWhile the minimum shift duration is four hours, where possible the shift length should be the \nsame as the shift length at the station to which the member is attached.  However, a shorter \nor longer shift length can be agreed if it suits the needs of the member and the workplace.      \nVPS Employees: Hours of work must include an agreed number of hours and days over a \nspecified period.  \nUnless the employee is a shift worker, part time hours of work must be rostered within the \nordinary span of hours of 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday.  An exception to this is if an \nemployee and their employer enter into an individual flexibility arrangement to meet the \ngenuine needs of both parties.  Such an individual flexibility arrangement that includes hours \nof work outside of the ordinary span of hours must be in writing and signed by both the \nemployee and their employer (the delegate for approval of the individual flexibility \narrangement is the Director, Workplace Relations, HRD).  \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \nEmployees must not work less than three consecutive hours on a work day, except in \nexceptional circumstances by agreement with the employer.  \nVariations to part time arrangements  \nThe employer and employee must regularly review agreed part time arrangements to assess \nwhether the arrangement continues to meet the needs of both parties.  If an employee \nchanges their work location, a new part time application form must be submitted.  \nWorkplace reviews can occur at any time, however it is advised that a review of the \nemployee\u2019s part time arrangement must be conducted at least every 12 months, where \npracticable.  Any review should be documented. \nAny review of a part time arrangement should have regard to the individual circumstances of \nthe employee, including, where relevant, the child-care requirements of that employee. \nReviews of part time arrangements must also take into account any requirements contained in \nthe Fair Work Act, the Equal Opportunity Act and the criteria stipulated in section 4.5.   \nPart time working arrangements may be varied by written agreement between the employee \nand the employer by completing and submitting an \u2018Application for a Part Time \nArrangement/Application to Vary Existing Part Time Arrangement\u2019 \u2013 apply through HR Assist, \nEmployee Self Service, Status Change. \nTemporary variations to agreed/rostered hours of duty of part time employees may occur at \nany time by prior mutual agreement between the employee and the employer.  \nPolice Members: Where the employer proposes to vary an existing arrangement and \nagreement cannot be reached, the employer may, upon the provision of six months\u2019 notice or \na longer period as is reasonable having regard to the employee\u2019s personal circu mstances, vary \nthe employee\u2019s pattern of hours.  \nDirected shift changes \nDirected changes to shifts of part time employees should only be considered in exceptional \noperational circumstances including when no other alternatives are available. The employer is \nto take into account an employee\u2019s individual circumstances before directing a temporary \nchange to the shifts of a part time employee.  \nWhere a directed change has occurred, overtime payments will apply in accordance with the \nenterprise bargaining agreements. \nIn certain circumstances where the employer has directed a change to an employee\u2019s shift, the \nemployer may be required to pay child care expenses. Child care expenses apply for VPS \nemployees as per clause 39 of the VPS agreement and for police members as per clause 164 \nof the sworn agreement.  \nPolice Members: Where the member\u2019s rostered shift is changed without the member\u2019s \nconsent and 48 hours or less notice is given, the change of shift penalty will apply under \nclause 36 of the sworn agreement.  \nOvertime payments and the change of shift penalty cannot apply for the same period of time \nand the member will be entitled to the higher penalty payable at any given time.  \nPart time police members should not normally be required to be available for resump tion of \nduty unless included in the \u2018Application for a Part Time Arrangement/Application to Vary \nExisting Part Time Arrangement\u2019 form.  Where part time members continue to be available for \nresumption of duty, payment is to be made in accordance with the sworn agreement.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \nVPS Employees: The employer may only direct a change where an emergency exists and \nthere are no other alternatives.  \nOvertime applies if the directed change is outside the normal span of hours of 7am to 7pm \nMonday to Friday or the employee works more than 38 hours per week.  \nReturn to full time employment \nA part time employee may revert to full time employment at any time, providing that an \nequivalent full time vacancy or sufficient residual hours exist; however, this is subject to \nsection 1.8 \u2013 Flexible working arrangements for employees returning from parental leave.   \nTime in position requirements do not apply to either promotion or transfer to a full time \nposition.  \nAn employee owning two part time positions may make the request to convert to full time in \neither of their existing positions, however if approved, would need to vacate their remaining \npart time position as they cannot work more than full time hours.  \nAny requests are to be considered in the context of service delivery needs and are subject to \navailability of sufficient residual hours. At management discretion, hours available within the \nPolice Service Area, Division, Region, Command or Department, in which the employee is \nlocated may be utilised.  \nEmployees may elect to accept a lesser rank/classification, and/or different duties in order to \nreturn to full time employment.   \n4.6 Conditions of employment \nPart time employees have, on a pro rata basis, the same terms and conditions as full time \nemployees.  \nAllowances  \nPolice members: are entitled to pro rata amounts for the uniform and civilian clothing \nallowances and commuted overtime allowance.  \nLeave  \nWorking part-time will impact the payment of long service leave - refer to the VPMG Long \nService Leave.   \nAccrual of recreation and personal and carers leave will be on a pro-rata basis. \nPolice members who work part-time (including those who own/occupy multiple part-time \npositions) are not eligible for accrued time off.   \nOvertime  \nAn employee may be required to work reasonable overtime in accordance with the provisions \nof the applicable workplace agreement.  \nPolice Members: Overtime will be paid for hours worked outside the ordinary hours specified \nin the member\u2019s Part Time Agreement at the rates contained in Part 6 of the sworn \nagreement; or the member may elect to take time off in lieu under Part 8 of the sworn \nagreement. This provision also applies for any attendance at training.    \n \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \nVPS Employees: Other than shift workers, additional hours up to and including 38 hours per \nweek will be paid at the ordinary hourly rate of pay. Hours directed by the employer and in \nexcess of 38 hours per week will be paid at the overtime rates specified in the VPS agreement. \nAssignments and temporary duties  \nVictoria Police\u2019s recruitment, allocation, assignment, transfer and promotion processes are \nconducted in a manner that provides fair and equitable opportunity to all employees. \nPart time employees may be assigned to other positions or duties, either full time or part time, \nin accordance with the Assignment process. Part time employees should be considered for \nassignment opportunities in the same way as full time employees.  \nWhere the assignment is \u2018directed\u2019, the employee\u2019s existing working pattern remains unless \notherwise agreed.  \nWhere a part time employee applies for an assignment with full time, or increased hours to \ntheir normal working pattern, a part time application will need to be submitted to cover the \nassignment period.  If it is agreed that the part time hours can be worked, the working pattern \narrangement for the higher duties period should be documented and signed by both  parties.  \nWhere a part time police member is assigned to a part time position, or to a full time position \non a part time basis, they may, by request and with the agreement of the employer, continue \nto perform the duties of their own position while assigned to another position, as long as their \nsum of rostered hours does not exceed 76 hours per fortnight.  A part time working pattern \nagreement for the assignment position should be documented and signed by both parties.   \nSurplus employees \nIf a part time position is abolished, the employee is declared surplus and is placed under the \nprovisions of 306-11 Redeployment (VPS) or VPM Mobility and redeployment (police \nmembers).  Where a part time position is not available, surplus staff will be matched to \nappropriate full time positions in consultation with the employee. The employee may apply \nfor the position, to which they are matched, to be converted to part time in accordance with \nsection 4.5 above.   \nSuperannuation \nPart time employment has implications for superannuation. Employees should seek \nsuperannuation advice from their fund before finalising their part time arrangements.  \nAttendance at Training \nAlternative methods of delivery of training will be considered to maximise opportunities for all \nemployees to access training.   \n4.7 Owning/Occupying two part time positions \nAn employee may own/occupy two part time positions at the same level/rank, and at the \nsame or different locations, provided that the sum of hours per fortnight does not exceed 76 \nhours per fortnight. Employees who own/occupy two part time positions must en sure that the \nhours for each position are compatible. The member must communicate with each authorised \ndelegate separately concerning any changes that may impact on either position. This includes \nthe impact of attendance at training.    \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \nWhen making decisions in relation to one of the positions the employee occupies, the \nauthorised delegate must consult with the authorised delegate of the other position occupied \nby the employee.  \nExamples of the types of decisions that authorised delegates should consult over are: a \ndirection to work overtime (to ensure that hours of both positions are taken into \nconsideration); approval of assignment or higher duties; the requirement to undertake \ncompulsory training.     \nTime in position \u2013 Police Members \nWhen a police member occupies two part time positions, time in position dates are the dates \nfor each individual position.  \nRate of pay \nThe employee shall receive all salaries, entitlements and allowances on a pro-rata basis for the \ntotal number of hours worked in both positions.  \nPromotion or reversion \u2013 Police Members \nWhen the member\u2019s rank changes (promotion or reversion) the member will be unattached \nfrom all positions at the previous rank.  \nWorkCover  \nWorkCover responsibilities are to be managed by the workplace in which the injury occurred.   \nIf it is not known when or where the injury occurred (e.g. injury occurring over a period of \ntime), then the claim should be managed by the workplace where the claim was lodged.  \n \nRelinquishing a position  \nThe employee may vacate one of the owned positions at any time in order to revert to owning \nonly one part time position. Where this occurs for police members, the member must not \napply for an additional part time position which involves the same hours as the relinquished \nposition until the balance of the time in position requirements of the relinquished position \nhave been met.   \n  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \n5. Flexi Time (VPS Employees only) \n5.1 Purpose \nVictoria Police is committed to providing flexibility in the workplace that takes into account \nthe work requirements of the organisation and the personal/family circumstances of the \nemployee.  \n5.2 Flexi time \nAn employee can work and accumulate flexi time by agreement between the employer and \nemployee: \n\u2022 where the Manager is satisfied that there is sufficient work to be performed; and  \n\u2022 where required, a sufficient level of supervision is available.  \nFlexi time must be negotiated within the normal span of hours between 7:00am and 7:00pm, \nMonday to Friday. Unless the employee and their manager have entered into an individual \nflexibility arrangement (IFA), any work performed outside of these hours is considered to be \novertime.  If entering into an IFA, contact the Workplace Relations Division. \nFlexi time is not generally available to sworn employees, shift workers, causal employees or \nVPSG-5 and above (and Forensic Officer equivalent), particularly those in management or \nsupervisory roles where business continuity would be adversely affected by flexi time \narrangements. In exceptional circumstances however, an individual arrangement may be \nreached between the parties.  \nWhere it is determined that the accrual of flexi time no longer meets the needs of the work \nunit, the Manager is required to consult with the relevant employees and the relevant union in \naccordance with the \u2018Implementation of change\u2019 provisions of the VPS Enterprise Agreement.  \n5.3 Flexi credit \nUnless exceptional circumstances exist, and approval is provided by the Manager to carry a \ngreater accrual, the maximum amount of flexi time credit allowed for a full time employee is \n15.2 hours, and for a part time employee is the equivalent of two days of their part time work \npattern.  \nWhere an employee has flexi time credit in excess of the allowable limit, the Manager may \ndirect the employee to take the excess hours, unless the flexi time credit is to cover a \nChristmas Closedown period in accordance with section 5.6 below.  \nWhere an employee does not use all of their flexi credit prior to the cessation of their \nemployment with Victoria Police, they will be entitled to have any outstanding credits paid out \nto them at their ordinary hourly rate of pay.  \n5.4 Flexi debit \nIn exceptional circumstances, an employee may take flexi time without the necessary flexi \ncredit being accrued. This can only occur with prior approval from the Manager and must not \nresult in a full time employee having a negative balance that exceeds \u2013 7.6 (negative) hours \nfor a full time employee or that exceeds -1 (negative) day for a part time employee. \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \nIf an employee has an excess flexi debit and does not reduce the debit within a reasonable \nperiod as specified by the Manager, the employee must elect to utilise either recreation leave \nor leave without pay to recoup the debit.  \nWhere an employee has a flexi debt on cessation of employment, money or leave owed by the \nemployee to the employer will be debited accordingly, at their ordinary hourly rate of p ay in \naccordance with the Financial Management Act 1994 (Vic), except where the cessation is due \nto death.   \n5.5 Taking flexi time \nFlexi time must only be taken with prior approval from the Employee\u2019s Manager. In making \nany assessment as to when flexi time can be taken, the Manager will give full consideration to \nthe employee\u2019s preferences; however, it may not always be possible for the employee to take \nflexi time on their nominated day due to the service delivery requirements of the work unit.  \nFlexi time should be taken as a full or half day based on the employee\u2019s ordinary hours of \nwork. At the discretion of the Manager, approval may be given to an employee to take flexi \nleave in hours.  \n5.6 Christmas closedown \nWhere a Work Unit Manager intends to closedown part or all of the unit\u2019s operations for the \nperiod from the first working day after Christmas Day to the first working day after New Year\u2019s \nDay (closedown period), the Work Unit Manager: \n\u2022 will notify relevant employees  in writing of this intention no later than 1 October of the \nyear in which the closedown is to take place \n\u2022 will request relevant employees to utilise any accrued time in lieu, annual leave, substitute \nleave, flexi time credits or additional hours accrued under a flexible working arrangement  \n\u2022 may require a minimum level of staffing to meet the operational requirements of the \nworkplace. \nIf there are insufficient expressions of interest from relevant employees to give effect to the \nclosedown period, the following process will be applied: \n\u2022 the Work Unit Manager may direct an employee who has excessive recreation leave (more \nthan eight weeks or two years accruals), to take recreation leave during the closedown \nperiod \n\u2022 the Work Unit Manager may then direct an employee with accrued time in lieu, flexi time  \ncredits or substitute leave to take that leave during the closedown period. \nThe Work Unit Manager will provide at least four weeks\u2019 notice of any direction to take leave.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \n6. Working from Home \n6.1 Overview \nVictoria Police aims to provide employment options to maximise workforce flexibility, and \npromote a balance between optimal service delivery and employees\u2019 personal commitments.  \n\u2022 Victoria Police will be fair and transparent in considering requests by employees to work \nfrom home. \n\u2022 Employees granted approval to work from home will continue to be provided with equal \nopportunities in their employment. \n\u2022 Individual working from home arrangements may be permitted on a short-term basis and \nwill be assessed regularly, having regard to both employees\u2019 personal responsibilities and \norganisational needs. \n\u2022 Employees are not to undertake work at home unless they have obtained approval in \naccordance with this guideline. \n6.2 Definitions \nHome Based Work (HBW) Location: the area designated by the employee within their home \nas the work location in which they will perform their home based work.  This includes areas \nthe employee accesses in their home when taking breaks; such as the kitchen, bathroom, \npassageways and staircases. \nHome Based Work (HBW) Arrangement: a flexible work arrangement that may be \nauthorised on a short term basis to help accommodate employees\u2019 occasional and \nintermittent personal commitments, and emergencies.   \nCarer: means a person, including a person under the age of 18 years, who provides care to \nanother person with whom he or she is in a care relationship.  \nCare relationship: a person is in a care relationship if they provide care to another person \nbecause they have a disability, are older, have a mental illness, or an ongoing medical \ncondition (including a terminal or chronic illness or dementia); or has care of a child under a \npermanent care order, child care agreement or protection order.  \nParent: includes parent, step-parent, adoptive parent, foster parent, guardian, or the spouse \nor domestic partner of a parent. \n6.3 Eligibility \nAll employees other than recruits, probationary constables and VPS employees who are within \ntheir probationary period are eligible to apply to work from home.  Any exception to this will \nonly be considered in exceptional circumstances. \n6.4 Information Management & Security \nPolicy adherence \n\u2022 All Authorised Users have a duty and responsibility to ensure that Victoria Police \ninformation is protected from harm, unauthorised or inappropriate disclosure.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \n\u2022 If Victoria Police employees have approval to work from home they must ensure that they \ncontinue to adhere to Victoria Police policy.  This includes maintaining the confidentiality, \nintegrity and availability of Victoria Police information. \n\u2022 To ensure the security of Victoria Police information, Authorised Users who are not \nVictoria Police employees are not to undertake work at home. \nRisks \nWorking from home increases a number of security risks for Victoria Police information \nincluding (but not limited to): \n\u2022 the potential for people without a \u2018need-to-know\u2019 or without an appropriate security \nclearance to gain access to (or read) official information or other official resources  \n\u2022 loss of Victoria Police information in transit between the workplace and home \n\u2022 viruses or other malicious code being present or being introduced to IT equipment.  \nSecurity classified information \n\u2022 Information that has been assessed as PROTECTED or above is not to be worked on using \nhome based computer equipment, unless this is done on the Victoria Police network \nthrough approved secure two-factor authentication (such as Connect.Police tokens).  \nRefer to Information categorisation, collection and recording Policy for information on \nsecurity classifications. \n\u2022 Hardcopy security classified information must be stored in a container suitable for the \nclassification of the material when not in use.  Refer to IMSSD guide \u2013 G200 \u2013 Assessment \nand handling of Victoria Police Information.  If a suitable security container is not \navailable, then the information should not be taken home. \n\u2022 Any deviation from these requirements requires approval by the Department Head after \nseeking advice from the Information Security Manager and the Protective Security \nManager, Information Management, Standards & Security Division. \n6.5 Occupational Health & Safety \nVictoria Police will provide and maintain, so far as is reasonably practicable, workplaces and \nworking environments that are safe and without risks to health for all employees and \nindividuals using Victoria Police premises, facilities or equipment.  This applies to an approv ed \nHome Based Work Location. \nEmployees granted approval to work from home must comply with their obligations under the \nVictorian Occupational Health and Safety Act and all relevant Victoria Police occupational \nhealth and safety policies and procedures, and take corrective action to eliminate all potential \nhazards within their Home Based Work Location.  Any hazards which cannot be immediately \ncorrected must be reported.  \nEmployees will be required to comply with all reasonable and lawful directions by Victor ia \nPolice from time to time, including directions regarding safe work methods which may require \nemployees to rearrange or alter the Home Based Work Location. \nEmployees must report all work related health and safety concerns or incidents that occur at \ntheir Home Based Work Location to Victoria Police as soon as is reasonably practicable.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual \n- Workplace Flexibility \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \n \n PUBLIC DOMAIN \n6.6 Applying \nApplication form \nEmployees applying for a Home Based Work Arrangement must complete an \u2018Application for \nHome Based Work\u2019 (including an OH&S Self-Assessment Checklist for their Home Based Work \nLocation) and submit it to their line manager for consideration.  Applications will be assessed \non a case by case basis and approval is at the discretion of management.   \nAccountability for considering Home Based Work applications remains with the approving \nlocation with final signoff required by Workplace Relations Division, HRD. \nEmployee responsibilities \nIn all cases where an employee submits a request to work from home, consultation must \noccur between the employee and their manager.  It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to ensure \nthat:  \n\u2022 their manager receives their written request in a timely manner; \n\u2022 they complete required forms and supply any supporting documentation to provide their \nmanager with sufficient information to reasonably consider their request; and \n\u2022 any changes in circumstances for the application are advised to their manager as soon as \npossible. \nManager responsibilities \nIn considering requests by employees to work from home, the manager must take i nto \naccount any relevant factors before providing the employee with a final decision.  These may \ninclude: \n\u2022 compliance with all applicable legislation \n\u2022 the nature of the responsibilities of the employee\u2019s position including supervision of other \nemployees, service response to other employees or the public, whether the employee \nrequires regular access to hard copy information and/or has access to sensitive o r \nprotectively marked information \n\u2022 the employee is fit for work.  Working from home is not a substitute for personal leave  \n\u2022 whether the security risk of accessing Victoria Police information to enable an employee \nto work from home is too significant (refer to section 6.8 for more detailed information) \n\u2022 any security arrangements that an employee will need to comply with to enable a Home \nBased Work arrangement to be approved \n\u2022 the employee\u2019s personal circumstances and the reason(s) underlying their request to work \nfrom home.

This means the organisation  and its employees are obliged to take steps \nto prevent discriminatory practices or behaviours, not just respond to issues or complaints of \ndiscrimination when they occur. \nTo meet this requirement:  \n\u2022 As an employer, Victoria Police maintains a workplace tha t values the diversity and \nindividuality of its employees and encourages a workplace that is inclusive, respectful and \nfair;  \n\u2022 As an employer, Victoria Police must exercise positive duty to accommodat e reasonable \nworkplace adjustments so that a person with disability can have equality of access, \nemployment and advancement opportunities (as per VPM Reasonable workplace \nadjustment); \n\u2022 All Victoria Police employees and others covered by this policy are expe cted to exercise \ntheir positive duty by preventing discri minatory practices and encourage behaviours that \ntreat others with dignity, courtesy and respect; and  \n\u2022 Policy owners must exercise positive duty by taking the necessary steps to eliminate barriers \nto equal opportunity when reviewing or developing systems, policy, training, infrastructure \nand equipment in their portfolio.  \nPositive duty refers to the duty of employers under Part 3 of the Equal Opportunity Act to take positive \naction to eliminate discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation. \nPolicy \nVictoria Police is committed to embedding organisational flexibility for all roles, adopting the Victorian \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to \u2018all roles flex\u2019 with a requirement to establish \u2018if not, why not\u2019 .

Reasonable business grounds include, but are not limited to: \n\u2212 the new working arrangement requested by the employee would be costly \n\u2212 there is no capacity to change the working arrangements of other employees \nto accommodate the new working arrangements requested by the employee \n\u2212 it would not feasible to change the working arrangements of other employees, \nor recruit new employees, to accommodate the new working arrangements \nrequested by the employee \n\u2212 the new working arrangements requested by the employee would be likely to \nresult in a significant loss in efficiency or productivity \n\u2212 the new working arrangements requested by the employee would be likely to \nhave a significant negative impact on customer service. \n\u2022 Impact on service delivery, resources, and opera tional requirements will be key \nconsiderations in all app lications Local impact and also organisational impact should be \nconsidered.  \n\u2022 Where an application cannot be accommodated due to reasonable business grounds, \nmanagement should consider any other means  by which the applicant can be assisted, \nincluding tempor ary transfer, performing temporary duties in close proximity to the  \nrequested work location, alternative flexible rostering arrangements, shift variations as \ndeemed appropriate, or other welfare support. \n\u2022 Police members only \u2013 prior to approving an applicat ion from a probationary officer or \nRecruit, consideration must be g iven to the above points and also to the impact on the \nemployee\u2019s training program, to ensure that all mandatory training requiremen ts are able \nto be completed in the requisite timeframes.  \n\u2022 Each application must be assessed on its merits and in light of the individual circumstances \nof the employee. \n1.6 Procedures and timeframes \n\u2022 Employees should submit their requests for flexible work arrangements in writing (using the \nrelevant form as specified in the policy section or general report VP form 47) to their local \nmanager as far in advance of the desired implementation of the requested change as \npossible to allow due consideration of the request. \n\u2022 Applications must include (see Checklist for further guidance): \n\u2212 details of the circumstances applicable to the request \n\u2212 an outline of the timeframe the circumstances will likely apply (where known) \n\u2212 supporting information or documentation to support the circumstances such as \nmedical reports, details of carer or parental responsibilities, and any other \ninformation that will assist management consideration of the application.  \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 A written response to the request (including the reasonable business grounds if refusing an \napplication) must be provided by their local management to the employee within 21 \ncalendar days of the employee submitting their written application. \n\u2022 In consideration of the requirement to respond in writing within 21 calendar days, local \nmanagement must: \n\u2212 provide to the Delegate in a timely manner, copies of the application  \nsupporting evidence, and local management's assessment of the application \n\u2212 if appropriate, convene a meeting with the Delegate for the purpose of \nconsidering the application, and/or employee to obtain further information in \nrelation to the application or to discuss the request, and/or alternative flexibility \narrangements.  \n1.7 Restrictions \nA flexible working arrangement must not breach any of the provisions of the relevant enterprise \nagreements, other applicable agreement, policy or legislation. \nAn approved flexible working arrangement is subject at all times to: \n\u2022 the powers of the Chief Commissioner to transfer a police member or VPS employee during \nthe term of their flexible working arrangement in accordance with the powers under the \nVictoria Police Act 2013 and/or the terms of the relevant enterprise agreement; and \n\u2022 Victoria Police's right to: \n\u2212 direct a police member to attend the Police Medical Officer; \n\u2212 direct a police member to participate in a mobility or redeployment process;  \n\u2212 compulsorily retire a police member on grounds of ill-health; or \n\u2212 request that a VPS employee obtain documentary evidence from an \nindependent Registered Practitioner. \nManagers need to be mindful of the possible legal implications of the above directions, such as \nan adverse action claim by an employee.  If in doubt, seek advice from WRD. \nNoting the above, it is possible to have a flexible working arrangement in place where an \nemployee works from another work loca tion (e.g. another police station or work location) but \nthis does not require a permanent transfer of their substantive position or work location. \n1.8 Duration of flexible working arrangement \nA request for a change in working arrangements will not be considered a permanent change in \nworking arrangements. Flexible wo rking arrangements may be subject to review at any time. \nSuch a review m ust be conducted at least every 12 months, where practica l to ensure the \narrangement still meets the needs of the employee and employer. Any review should be \ndocumented, and a copy retained on the employee's file. \n1.9 Variations \n\u2022 An employee and their manager m ay seek to  vary a flexible working arrangement as \nrequired.  Variations are subject to policy and legislative requirements.   \n\u2022 Any variation to an e mployee\u2019s working arrangements should  be documented and signed \nby both parties, and copies retained on the employee's file.  \n\u2022 For more details about documenting arrangements, refer to each of the relevant sections \nfor specific workplace flexibility arrangements or to specific policies (e.g. VPM Leave). \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n9 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n1.10 Recording of hours of work \nAll employees must complete, maintain and submit records of attendance in accordance with \nthe requirements outlined in the applicable enterprise agreement. \n1.11 Flexible working arrangements for employees returning from parental leave \n\u2022 If a request for flexible working arrangement is granted (including by a full-time employee \nwho has taken parental leave to return to work on a part-time basis), this does not constitute \na permanent change to the employee\u2019s position with Victoria Police. \n\u2022 If a full -time employee who has returned from parental leave works on a part -time basis \npursuant to a flexible working arrangement, they are entitled to return to their substantive \nfull-time position once the flexible working arrangement ends, an d the procedure set out \nin this policy will not apply.  \n1.12 Recording of decisions \nOnce a decision has been made in respect of a request for flexible working arrangements, a \ncopy of the application form, decision and reasons for it must be retained on the employee's \nfile. \n1.13 Review of actions \nMonitoring processes are necessary to ensure that Victoria Police maintains control  of its \nworkplace flexibility arrangements. Mechanisms for ensuring that the arrangem ents are \nmanaged efficiently includes the oversight of review of actions  to ensure applications for \nworkplace flexibility comply with policy and guidelines and workplace flexibility review of \nactions are resolved in accordance with these. Where an applicat ion for a flexible work \narrangement has been refused, in accordance with VPM Review of actions (grievance), local \nissue resolution should be attempted in the first instance. If this is unsuccessful in resolving the \nreview of actions , a review of actions  can be submitted on a Workplace Relations Review of \nActions Form to the Review of actions Registrar within 28 calendar days of notification of the \nworkplace flexibility outcome. Advice can be sought from WRD at any stage.   \n \n2. Pregnancy in the workplace \n2.1 Overview \n\u2022 Victoria Police is committed to providing and maintain ing a working environment for all \npregnant employees that is safe and without risks to health.  \n\u2022 So far as is reasonably practica l, pregnant employees will be provided with the option to \nundertake alternative duties aimed at ensuring that there is minimal r isk to the pregnant \nemployee, their pregnancy as well as colleagues and members of the public who require \npolice assistance.    \n\u2022 Pregnancy, or potential pregnancy, must not be used as a basis on which to discriminate or \nharass an employee and such employees  must not be denied or limited access to \nopportunities for promotion, transfer or training or to any other benefits connected with \ntheir employment.  \n2.2 Definitions \nRegistered Medical Practitioner:  means a  registered Doctor of Medicine and includes an \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nObstetrician.  \n2.3 Notification and risk assessment \nOnce pregnant, some aspects of an employee\u2019s role may pose risks to the employee and their \npregnancy. For this reason, pregnant employees are encouraged to notify their manager of their \npregnancy as soon as practica ble, taking into consideration that some roles will pose higher \nhealth and safety risks to the employee and their pregnancy than others . At least 10 weeks\u2019 \nnotice of the intention to take parental leave must be provided, including the proposed start \nand end dates and the expected due date. Notification should include a confinement certificate \nfrom a Registered Medical Practitioner confirming the pregnancy and expected due date.   \nThe manage r is to ens ure that the notification of pregnancy is treated confide ntially and is \nrespectful of the pregnant employee.   \nEarly notification will ensure that a risk assessment can be conducted to determine appropriate \nduties during the pregnancy to avoid placing the pregnant employee or their pregnancy at risk.  \nAn occupat ional health and safety risk assessment of the employee\u2019s duties should be \nconducted by the manager, in consultation with the employee, and this will be based primarily \non advice from the employee\u2019s Registered Medical Practitioner. This will enable an informed \ndecision to be made  on the basis of the Registered Medical Practitioner\u2019s advice  regarding \nappropriate duties during the pregnancy  taking into consideration  identified risks in the wo rk \nenvironment. The employee must provide the employer with a certificate from their Registered \nMedical Practitioner using the \u2018 Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019  \u2013 \nrefer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Practitioner Guides and Resources\u201d. \nAny risk assessment must take into account the following:    \n\u2022 any potential risks to the health and safety of the pregnant employee and their pregnancy  \n\u2022 an OHS risk assessment of the work environment \n\u2022 the pregnant employee\u2019s preferences and circumstances including level of expertise \n\u2022 Operational Safety Tactics and Training (OSTT) requirements for operational duties \n\u2022 medical advice.   \nIt is the employee\u2019s responsibility to provide their Registered Medical Practitioner with a copy \nof the \u2018Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019 for them to complete.  \nIn consultation with their manager, an employee will be required to complete the \u2018Workplace \nSupport Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in Touch, and Return to Work from Parental Leave\u2019. The plan  is \nintended to support employees and their managers through the process. \nFor further guidance on the workplace risk assessment and the \u2018Medical Information Pack and \nCertification Form\u2019  also refer to the \u2018Pregnancy in the Workplace and Return to Work after  \nParental Leave Guide\u2019, this can be found on VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Employment \nand mobility, Practitioner Guides and Resources\u201d. \n2.4 Duties during pregnancy \n\u2022 Appropriate duties that have been determined, and as agreed between the manager and \nthe employee, must be reco rded on the \u2018Workplace Support Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in \nTouch, and Return to Work from Parental Leave\u2019.  \n\u2022 If the work duties that have been agreed to, for the period of pregnancy, differ from the \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n11 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nemployee\u2019s substantive position, the employee will continue t o own and occupy their \nsubstantive position whilst performing the temporary duties. The employee will continue to \nreceive remuneration at their substantive rank/classification.  \n\u2022 Duties undertaken by a pregnant employee must be reviewed on a regular basis t o ensure \nthat they do not expose the employee to unnecessary risk. This review might inform further \nchanges to the duties which can be safely perf ormed. The employee must notify their \nregistered medical practitioner and their manager of any developments in  the pregnancy \nthat may present as a health risk so that appropriate adjustments to duties can be made.   \n\u2022 Refer to section 2.5 for information on transfer to a safe job. \nHigher duties \n\u2022 Where a pregnant employee is undertaking a higher duties assignment but,  due to the \npregnancy cannot perform all of the duties of  that assignment, and alternative duties or \nreasonable adjustments to work responsibilities at the higher rank/classification c annot be \naccommodated, the employee will no longer be eligible for the full higher duties allowance \nand will revert to their substantive position.  \n\u2022 For VPS employees, if the pregnant employee undertakes part of the duties of a higher \nclassified position, t he level of the allowance shall be in proportion to the extent of the \nhigher duties being performed  (refer to VPM Remuneration  for more information on \nhigher duties). \nShift work \nFollowing the risk assessment the employee may be exempt from shift work or night shift where, \non the basis of the risk assessment  (and/or advice from a Registered Medical Practitioner) it is \ndetermined that there are additional risks to the employee\u2019s safety during those shifts or where \na medical certificate accompanies the request.  \nOperational Safety and Tactics Training (OSTT)/Operational and Promotional Training \n\u2022 A decision regarding the completion of OSTT or other operational and promotional training \nduring pregnancy is one that the employee should only make following considerat ion of \nthe information provided in the \u2018Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019, and must \nbe consistent with advice prov ided by their  medical practitioner. Pregnant employees \nwanting to undertake OSTT or other operational and promotion training must discuss the \nrisks associated with the training with their medical pra ctitioner and obtain medical \nclearance to do so.   \n\u2022 For the avoidance of  doubt, pregnant employees can be selected for promotions with a \nphysical component. This component may be completed upon the selectee\u2019s return to \noperational duties from parental leave. \n2.5 Entitlements during pregnancy \nDress for police members \n\u2022 Where the member\u2019s uniform can no longer be worn comfortably due to their pregnancy, \nthe member will be permitted to wear plain (professional) clothes.  \n\u2022 Pregnant members performing duties in plain cl othes are entitled to receive a temporary \ncivilian clothing allowance. \n \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n12 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nTransfer to a safe job  \n\u2022 Where an employee is pregnant and, in the opinion of a Registered Medical Practitioner, is \nfit for work, but it is inadvisable for them to continue at their present work because of illness \nor risks arising out of their pregnancy or hazards connected with the work assigned to the \nemployee, the employee will be transferred, if reasonably practicable, to an appropriate safe \njob for the risk period.    \n\u2022 The safe job m ay involve working from a different location, or may mean modifying the \nemployee's existing role to remove any identified risks. This will depend on the result of the \nrisk assessment and opinion of the medical practitioner. \n\u2022 The safe job must involve meanin gful duties, be commensurate with the employee\u2019s skills, \ntraining and experience. This may include bringing work from another work location within \nVictoria Police or the employee working from an alternative work location for a specific \nperiod or the duration of the pregnancy.  \n\u2022 The safe job will not alter the empl oyee\u2019s terms and conditions of employm ent. The \nemployee will have the same ordinary hours of work as the employee\u2019s present position; or \na different number of ordinary hours as agreed by the employee and employer.   \n\u2022 Where an employee reduces their hours to  better cope with their pregnancy, any  paid \nparental leave subsequently taken will be paid at the rate of pay applicable prior the \nreduction in ordinary hours.  \n\u2022 If a transfer to an appropriate safe job is not reasonably practicable, the employee may \nelect, or the employer may require the emplo yee to commence paid no safe job leave for \nsuch period as is certified necessary by a Registered Medical Practitioner or until the end of \nthe pregnancy. \n2.6 Leave \nLeave, including pre-natal leave, is granted in accordance with the VPM Leave. \n \n3. Lactation breaks \n3.1 Principles \nVictoria Police is committed to fostering a supportive work environment for employees who \nchoose to breastfeed by: \n\u2022 providing appropriate workplace facilities for employees who choose to express breast milk \nor breastfeed their child \n\u2022 providing paid lactation breaks during work hours \n\u2022 ensuring all employees\u2019 awareness of breastfeeding policies and facilities \n\u2022 seeking to eliminate any unlawful direct and/or indirect discrimination on the grounds of \nbreastfeeding. \nEmployees who choose t o breastfeed should be supported in that choice and treated with \ndignity and respect in the workplace. \n3.2 Definitions \nBreastfeeding: for the purpose of this policy, this includes t he physiological process of milk \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n13 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nbeing produced to breastfeed or express breast milk for an infant or young child.  \nCaregiver: a caregiver is a person who assumes responsibility for bringing an infant or young \nchild onto Victoria Police premises with the i ntent of delivering the infant or young child to an \nemployee for the purpose of breastfeeding. \nLactation breaks: paid breaks taken by an  employee in consultation with their employer for \nthe sole purpose of enabling an employee to express breast milk or bre astfeed an infant or \nyoung child off site or at the workplace. \nYoung child: generally refers to a child up to two years of age; however consideration should \nbe given to employee\u2019s individual circumstances and needs for breastfeeding a child. \n3.3 Breastfeeding facilities \n\u2022 Workplace facilities should be provided, where practical, for empl oyees who choose to \nexpress breast milk or breastfeed their child during work hours. \n\u2022 Facilities should be accessible for all, in terms of space, location and security access.  \n\u2022 The minimum requirements for an appropriate workplace facility include, where practicable: \n\u2212 a private, clean and hygienic space which is suitably signed and lockable \n\u2212 appropriate seating, a table or bench to support breastfeeding (and \nbreastfeeding equipment) \n\u2212 a power point for breast pumps and other equipment \n\u2212 access in the workplace, to a refrigerator/freezer for storing milk and a \nmicrowave \n\u2212 access to a sink with hot water for washing hands and equipment \n\u2212 nappy change table                       \n\u2212 an appropriate receptacle for rubbish and nappy disposal.   \n\u2022 It is not app ropriate for employees to breastfeed or express breast milk in toilet facilities, \nnor is it an appropriate location for equipment to be cleaned. Sinks and refrigeration located \nin a staffroom or kitch en facility should be used. Refer to the Australian Brea stfeeding \nAssociation website for guidance on storage of expressed milk, if required.   \n\u2022 Generally, workplace facilities should be used, however consideration should be given to \nallowing the employee to go home, to a caregivers home or accessing a child care centre if \nrequested.  Requests should be assessed on a case by case basis. \n3.4 Lactation breaks \nThe frequency, duration and timing of lactation breaks: \n\u2022 should be determined through consultation  between the employee and their manager to \nallow the flexibility needed to breastfeed or express milk \n\u2022 will vary between individuals and may be influenced by factors including the child\u2019s age, \nfeeding habits, the location of the breastfeeding room and any special requirements  \n\u2022 will likely reduce in frequency and increase  in flexibility for scheduling around operational \nneeds over time. Generally they are likely to be no more than 30 minutes in duration, and \nrequired around twice per 8 hour shift. However the employee \u2019s individual circumstances \nand needs should be taken into consideration. Employees working greater shift lengths will \nbe provided, where required, with an additional break of up to 30 minutes. The needs of \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n14 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nemployees working less than 8 hours will be assessed on a case by case basis according to \ntheir circumstances \n\u2022 are to be documented in a \u2018Lactation Breaks Plan\u2019, which should be reviewed on a regular \nbasis \u2013 refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Employment and mobility, Practitioner \nGuides and Resources\u201d.  A copy of the agreement should be retained by each party \n\u2022 should be timed where possible  to take into account reasonable business and \norganisational needs with a focus on  supporting employee health, while  minimising \ndisruption to the workplace and service delivery. If, in emergency situations, there is a need \nto delay the taking of a lactation break, efforts should be made to ensure that the employee \nis able to take the break as soon as practicable in order to mitigate any risks to the \nemployee\u2019s health or milk supply or the child\u2019s health \n\u2022 where the child or infant is breastfed offsite, the lactation break is inclusive of the time \nneeded to travel directly to and from the agreed location. Where this cannot be  achieved \nwithin the break of 30 minutes, alternate arrangements may be negotiated.   \n3.5 Responsibilities \nEmployees  \n\u2022 An employee intending to continue breastfeeding when returning to work should discuss \ntheir needs with their immediate manager prior to returning to work.   \n\u2022 The employee is responsible for:  \n\u2212 providing their own expressing and sterilising equipment and storage \ncontainers \n\u2212 ensuring that stored breast milk is properly secured, labelled and safely stored \nin a sealed receptacle \n\u2212 providing appropriate nappy change items should the infant or young child be \ndelivered to the workplace \n\u2212 ensuring hygiene is maintained at all times, such as washing hands, hygienic \ndisposal of nappies and rubbish, and leaving the workplace facility clean and \ntidy. \n\u2022 In addition, the employee is responsible for ensuring the caregiver: \n\u2212 is aware their access to the workplace is restricted to delivering the infant or \nyoung child to the employee for the purpose of breastfeeding \n\u2212 vacates the workplace with the infant(s) and/or young child at the complet ion \nof each breastfeeding break \n\u2212 supervises the infant(s) and/or young child at all times in the workplace. \nManagers  \n\u2022 The manager is responsible for:  \n\u2212 discussions occurring before an employee returns to work \n\u2212 ensuring the employee is not subjected to inappropriate behaviour or attitudes \nby other employees \n\u2212 ensuring appropriate facilities are available for lactation breaks \n\u2212 ensuring that decisions made regarding requests for lactation breaks are \nimpartial, transparent and capable of review \n\u2212 reviewing arrangements with the employee on a regular basis \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n15 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2212 where emergency situations result in a delay to scheduled lactation breaks, \nensuring that the employee is able to take their break as soon as possible to \nmitigate any health and safety risks. \n\u2022 Where having considered all options, a manager anticipates that it will not be possible to \naccommodate lactation breaks, advice must be sought from WRD. \n \n4. Part-time Employment \n4.1 Objectives \n\u2022 All part-time work arrangements should take into consideration any relevant operational \nand service delivery requirements, ros tering principles and the employee\u2019s individual \ncircumstances.  \n\u2022 Part-time employees will have the same opportunities as other employees in all aspects of \nemployment, including access to training , professional development, assignments and \npromotion.  \n4.2 Definitions \nThe definitions outlined in section 1.2 of this policy apply to this section. \n4.3 Part-time employment \n\u2022 An employee may work on a part-time basis where the employee has been selected for a \npart-time position which was advertised (employer initiated), or t he employee has applied \nand been approved to convert their  existing position to part-time (employee initi ated). \nEmployee initiated also applies where a position has been advertised as full time but an \nemployee has been selected on a part-time basis.  \n\u2022 This procedure does not apply to employees being rehabilitated under WorkCover ( see \nVPMP Injury Management and Return to Work) or where an employee works on a part-\ntime basis pursuant to a flexible working arrangement. \n\u2022 The ordinary hours of work must be contain ed in a written agreement signed by the \nemployee and the employer and will include a set number of days or a set number of hours \nof work (or both) over an agreed period. \n4.4 Employer initiated: advertised part-time positions \nA part-time position may be advertised where there is a vacant part-time position, a new part-\ntime position has been created or a vacant pos ition has been converted to part-time at the \nnomination of the employer.  \nEligibility  \nVPS Employees \n\u2022 All employees are eligible to apply for part-time employment.  \n\u2022 In addition, to assist a VPS employee in reconciling work and parental responsibilities, they \nmay request to return to work from parental leave at a reduced time-fraction until their \nchild reaches school age, after which they will have a right to resume their pre-parental \nleave substantive time-fraction.  \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n16 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nPolice members \n\u2022 All members are eligible to apply for part-time employment subject to the below time in \nposition exceptions.  \n\u2022 Time in position requirements do not prevent a police member from a pplying for an \nadvertised part-time position except where:  \n\u2212 the member owns a special category or priority status position; or  \n\u2212 the new position involves the same hours of work as the member\u2019s current \nposition and it would be the only position occupied by the member.  \n\u2022 Advertisements for part-time positions must specify the number of fortnightly hours, and \nmay specify a proposed pattern of hours.  \n\u2022 An advertised part-time position must have identical qualifications to the full-time \nequivalent position, including OSTT.  \n\u2022 Appointment to an advertised part-time position is subject to the member and the \nemployer reaching agreement on a work pattern and completing  and submitting an  \n\u2018Application for a Part-time Arrangement/Application to Vary Existing Part-time \nArrangement\u2019 \u2013 apply through HR Assist, Employee Self Service, Status Change. \n4.5 Employee initiated: applications for and variations to part-time employment, or changes \nto ordinary rostering arrangements \nEligibility rules and procedures are set out in the Workplace Flexibility section.  \nWork pattern  \nPolice members \n\u2022 Hours of work for part-time members can be structured in a number of different ways \nincluding:  \n\u2212 set start and finishing times on each day; and/or \n\u2212 a number of hours and days over a specified period. \n\u2022 Part-time arrangements can include a written agreement that pro vides for an agreed \nnumber of hours and days to be worked flexibly. This means that a process can be included \nin a part-time arrangement, which sets out parameters for any alteration to the pattern of \nthe hours on a fortnightly basis, with a view to meetin g the employee\u2019s work/life balance \nand taking into account the operational requirements of the employer.  Any such provision \nmust be recorded in a written application for a flexible work arrangement, or application to \nvary an existing flexible work arrangement.  \n\u2022 The pattern of hours of a part-time member may vary from the standard roster at a work \narea only with the agreement of the employer.  \n\u2022 While the minimum shift duration  is four hours, where poss ible the shift length should be \nthe same as the shift leng th at the station to which the member is attached. However, a \nshorter or longer shift length can be agreed if it suits the needs of the member and the \nworkplace.   \nVPS employees \n\u2022 Hours of work must include an agreed number of hours and days over a specified period. \n\u2022 Unless the employee is a shift worker, part-time hours of work must be rostered within the \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n17 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nordinary span of hours of 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday . An exception to t his is if an \nemployee and their employer enter into an individual flexibility arrang ement to meet the \ngenuine needs of both parties. Such an individual flexibility arrangement that includes hours \nof work outside of the ordinary span of hours must be in writing and signed by both th e \nemployee and their employer  (the delegate for approval o f the individual flexibility \narrangement is the Director, WRD).  \n\u2022 Employees must not work less than three consecutive hours on a work day, except in \nexceptional circumstances by agreement with the employer.  \nVariations to part-time arrangements  \n\u2022 The employe r and employee must regularly review agreed part-time arrangements to \nassess whether the arrangement continues to meet the needs of both parties. If an \nemployee changes their work location, a new part-time application form must be \nsubmitted.  \n\u2022 Workplace rev iews can occur at an y time, however it is advised that a review of the \nemployee\u2019s part-time arrangement should be conducted at least every 12 months, where \npractical. Any review should be documented and retained on the employee's file, submitted \nthrough HR Assist, Employee Self Service, Status Change.  \n\u2022 Any review of a part-time arrangement should have regard to the individual circumstances \nof the employee, including, where relevant, the child -care requirements of that employee. \nReviews of part-time arrangements must also take into account any requirements contained \nin the Fair Work Act, the Equal Opportunity Act and the criteria stipulated in the Workplace \nFlexibility section of this policy.   \n\u2022 Part-time working arrangements may be varied in writing between the employee and th e \nemployer in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Workplace Flexibility section. \n\u2022 Temporary variations to agreed/rostered hours of duty of part-time employees may occur \nat any time following discussion between the employee and the employer.  \nPolice members \nWhere the employer proposes to vary an existing arrangement and agreement cannot be \nreached, the emplo yer may, upon the provision of six  months\u2019 notice or a longer perio d as is \nreasonable having regar d to the employee\u2019s persona l circumstances, vary the employee\u2019s \npattern of hours.   \nDirected shift changes \n\u2022 Directed changes to shifts of part-time employees should only be considered in exceptional \noperational circumstances including when no other alternatives are available. The employer \nis to take into account an employee\u2019s individual circumstances before directing a temporary \nchange to the shifts of a part-time employee.  \n\u2022 Where a directed change has occurred, payments will a pply in accordance with the \nenterprise agreements. \n\u2022 In certain circumstances where the employer has directed a change to an employee\u2019s shift, \nthe employer may be required to pay child-care expenses.

Where part-time members continue to be available \nfor resumption of duty, payment is to be made in accordance with the applicable enterprise \nagreement.  \nVPS employees \n\u2022 The employer may only direct a change where an emergency exists and there are no other \nalternatives.  \n\u2022 Overtime applies if the directed change is outside the normal span of hours of 7am to 7pm \nMonday to Friday or the employee works more than 38 hours per week.  \nReturn to full-time employment \n\u2022 A part-time employee may revert to full-time employment at any time, providing that an \nequivalent full-time vacancy or sufficient residual hours exist; however, t his is s ubject to \nsection 1.11 \u2013 Flexible working arrangements for employees returning from parental leave.   \n\u2022 Time in position requirements do not apply to either promotion or transfer to a full-time \nposition.  \n\u2022 An employee owning two part-time positions may make the request to convert to full-time \nin either of their exist ing positions, however if approved, would n eed to vacate their \nremaining part-time position as they cannot work more than full-time hours.  \n\u2022 Any requests are to be considered in the context of servi ce delivery needs and are subject \nto availability of sufficient residual hours. At management discretion, hours available within \nthe Police Service Area, Division, Region, Command or Department, in which the employee \nis located may be utilised.  \n\u2022 Employees are not precluded from accepting different duties and/or a lesser \nrank/classification in order to return to full-time employment (this will mean being paid at \nthat rank/classification). \n4.6 Conditions of employment \nPart-time employees have, on a pro rata basis , the same terms and conditions as full-time \nemployees.  \nAllowances  \nPolice members  \n\u2022 Are entitled to pro rata amounts for the uniform and civilian clothing allowances and \ncommuted overtime allowance.  \n \n \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n19 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nLeave  \n\u2022 Working part-time will impact the payment of long service leave - refer to the VPM Leave.   \n\u2022 Accrual of recreation and personal and carers leave will be on a pro-rata basis. \n\u2022 Police members who work part -time (including those who own/occupy multiple part -time \npositions) are not eligible for accrued time off.   \nOvertime  \nAn employee may be required to work reasona ble overtime in accordance with the provisions \nof the applicable enterprise agreements.  \nPolice Members \nOvertime will be paid for hours worked outside the ordinary hours specified in the member\u2019s  \nPart-time Agreement at the rates contained in the  applicable enterprise agreement ; or the \nmember may elect to take time off in lieu under the  applicable enterprise agreement . This \nprovision also applies for any attendance at training.    \nVPS employees \nOther than shift workers, additional hours up to and including 3 8 hours per week will b e paid \nat the ordinary hourly rate of pay. Hours directed by the employer and in excess of 38 hours \nper week will be paid at the overtime rates specified in the applicable enterprise agreement. \nAssignments and temporary duties  \n\u2022 Victoria Police\u2019s recruitment, allocation, assignment, transfer and promotion processes are \nconducted in a manner that provides fair and equitable opportunity to all employees.  \n\u2022 Part-time employees may be assigned to other positions or duties, either full-time or part-\ntime, in accordance with the assignment process. Part-time employees should be \nconsidered for assignment opportunities in the same way as full-time employees.  \n\u2022 Higher duties assignments ma y be shared by two part-time employees, if applicable. S ee \nVPM Remuneration for more details.  \n\u2022 Where the assignment is \u2018directed\u2019, the employee\u2019s existing working pattern remains unless \notherwise agreed.  \n\u2022 Where a part-time employee applies for an assignment with full-time or increased hours to \ntheir normal working pattern, a part-time application will need to be submitted to cover the \nassignment period.  If it is agreed that the part-time hours can be  worked, the working \npattern arrangement for the higher du ties period should be documented and signed by \nboth parties.  \n\u2022 Where a part-time police member is assigned to a part-time position, or to a full-time \nposition on a part-time basis, they may, by request and with the agreement of the employer, \ncontinue to perform the duties of their own position while assigned to another position, as \nlong as their sum of rostered hours does not exceed 76 hours per fortnight. A part-time \nworking pattern agreement for the assignment position should be documented and signed \nby both parties.   \nSurplus employees \nIf a part-time position is ab olished, the employee is declared surplus and is placed under the \nprovisions of 306-11 Redeployment (VPS) or VPM Mobility and redeployment ( police \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n20 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nmembers). Where a part-time position is not avai lable, surplus staff will be matched to \nappropriate full-time positions in consultation with the employee. The employee may apply for \nthe position, to which they are matched, to be converted to part-time in accordance with section \n4.5 above.   \nSuperannuation \nPart-time employment has implications for superannuation. Employees should seek \nsuperannuation advice from their fund before finalising their part-time arrangements.  \nAttendance at training \nAlternative methods of delivery of training will be considered to maximise opportunities for all \nemployees to access trainin g. Short term changes to a part -time or flexible working \narrangement will also be considered to allow attendance at training.    \n4.7 Owning/occupying two part-time positions \n\u2022 An employee may own/occup y two part-time positions at the same level/rank, and at the \nsame or different locations, provided that the sum of hours per fortnight does not exceed \n76 hours per fortnight. Employees who own/occupy two part-time positions must ensure \nthat the hours for each position are compatible. The member must communicate with each \nauthorised delegate separately concerning any changes that may impact on either position. \nThis includes the impact of attendance at training.    \n\u2022 When making decisions in relation to one of the position s the employee occupies, the \nauthorised delegate must consult with the authorised delegate of the other position \noccupied by the employee.  \n\u2022 Examples of the types of decisions that authorised delegates should consult over are:  \n\u2212 a direction to work overtime (to ensure that hours of both positions are taken \ninto consideration)  \n\u2212 approval of assignment or higher duties \n\u2212 the requirement to undertake compulsory training.     \nTime in position \u2013 police members \nWhen a police member occupies two part-time positions, time in position dates are the dates \nfor each individual position.  \nRate of pay \nThe employee shall receive all salaries, entitlements and allowances on a pro -rata basis for the \ntotal number of hours worked in both positions.  \nPromotion or reversion \u2013 police members \nWhen the member\u2019s rank changes (promotion  or reversion) the member will be unattached \nfrom all positions at the previous rank.  \nWorkCover  \nWorkCover responsibilities are to be managed by the workplace in which the injury occurred. If \nit is not known when or where the injury occurred (e.g.: injury occurring over a period of time), \nthen the claim should be managed by the workplace where the claim was lodged.  \nRelinquishing a position  \nThe employee may vacate one of the owned positions at a ny time in order to revert to owning \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n21 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nonly one part-time position. Where this occurs for police members, the member must not apply \nfor an additional part-time position which involves the same hours as the relinquished position \nuntil the balance of the time in position requirem ents of the relinquished position have be en \nmet.   \n4.8 Residual hours  \nManagement may give consideration to using residual part -time hours to create and advertise \nadditional part-time positions within their establishment in order to fulfil the requirements of \npart of a role or fraction of unit. \nHowever, managers need to be mindful that surplus part-time hours (e.g. arising from requests \nby employees who have bee n on parental leave  to return to work on a part -time basis) are \nbeing managed appropriately. These hours must not be used to create new perman ent \npositions that would prevent an employee on flexible arrangements from returning to full time \nhours.  \nThe reason for this is t o assist an employee in reconciling work and parental responsi bilities, \nemployees have the right to request to return to work at a reduced time-fraction until the child, \nor the youngest child, reaches school age, after which the employee will resume their \nsubstantive time-fraction or make application to work part-time as a flexible work arrangement, \nthis can be a permanent or temporary part-time arrangement.  \nDuring this time, the employee is on a temporary part-time agreement and the residual hours \n(FTE) either need to be quarantined or guaranteed to be restored on resumption of the \nemployee\u2019s pre parental leave hours (FTE).   \n \n5. Flexi-time (VPS employees only) \n5.1 Purpose \nVictoria Police is committed to providing flexibility in the workplace that takes into account the \nwork requirements of the organisation and the personal/family circumstances of the employee.  \n5.2 Flexi-time \n\u2022 An employee can work and accumulate flexi-time by agreement between the employer and \nemployee: \n\u2212 where the manager is satisfied that there is sufficient work to be performed; \nand  \n\u2212 where required, a sufficient level of supervision is available.  \n\u2022 Flexi-time must be negotia ted within the normal span of hours between 7:00am and \n7:00pm, Monday to Friday. Unless the employee and their manager have entered into an \nindividual flexibility arrangement (IFA), any work perf ormed outside of these hours is \nconsidered to be overtime. If entering into an IFA, contact WRD. \n\u2022 Flexi-time is not generally available to  police members, shift workers, causal employees or  \nVPSG-5 and above (and Forensic Officer equivalent), particularly th ose in management or \nsupervisory roles where business continu ity would be adversely affecte d by flexi -time \narrangements. In exceptional circumstances however, an individual arrangement may be \nreached between the parties.  \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n22 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 Where it is determined that the accrual of flexi-time no longer meets the needs of the work \nunit, the manager is required to consult with the relevant employees and the relevant union \nin accordance with the \u2018Implementation of change\u2019 provisions of the relevant enterprise \nagreement. \n5.3 Flexi-credit \n\u2022 Unless exceptional circumstances exist, and approval is provided by the manager to carry a \ngreater accrual, the maximum amount of flexi-time credit allowed for a full-time employee \nis 15.2 hours, and for a part-time employee is the equivalent of two days of their part-time \nwork pattern.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has flexi-time credit in excess of the allowable limit, the manager may \ndirect the employee to take the excess hours, unless the flexi -time credit is to cover a \nChristmas Closedown period in accordance with section 5.6 of this policy.  \n\u2022 Where an employee does n ot use all of their flexi -credit prior to the cessation of their \nemployment with Victoria Police, they will be entitled to have any outstanding credits paid \nout to them at their ordinary hourly rate of pay.  \n5.4 Flexi-debit \n\u2022 In exceptional circumstances, an employee may take flexi-time without the necessary flexi-\ncredit being accrued. This can only occur with prior approval from the manager and must \nnot result in a full-time employee having a negative balance that exceeds -7.6 (negative) \nhours for a full-time employee or that exceeds -1 (negative) day for a part-time employee. \n\u2022 If an employee has an excess flexi-debit and does not reduce the debit within a reasonable \nperiod as specified by the manager, the employee must elect to utilise either recreation \nleave or leave without pay to recoup the debit.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has a flexi-debit on cessation of employment, money or leave owed by \nthe employee to the employer will be debited accordingly, at their o rdinary hourly rate of \npay in accordance with the Financial Management Act 1994 (Vic), except where the cessation \nis due to death.   \n5.5 Taking flexi-time \n\u2022 Flexi-time must only be taken with prior approval from the employee\u2019s manager. In making \nany assessment as to when flexi-time can be taken, the manager will give full consideration \nto the employee\u2019s preferences; however, it may not always be possible for the employee to \ntake flexi-time on their nominated day due to the service delivery requirements of the work \nunit.  \n\u2022 Flexi-time should be taken as a full or half day bas ed on the employee\u2019s ordinary hours of \nwork. At the discretion of the manager, approval may be given to an employee to take flexi-\nleave in hours.  \n5.6 Christmas closedown \n\u2022 Where a work unit manager intends to closedown part or all of the unit\u2019s operations for the \nperiod from the first working day after Christmas Day to the first working day after New \nYear\u2019s Day (closedown period), the work unit manager: \n\u2212 will notify relevant employees in writing of this intention no later than 1 \nOctober of the year in which the closedown is to take place \n\n \nVictoria Po lice Man ua l  \n\u2013 Workplace fle xib ility  \n  \n \n \n \n23 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2212 will request relevant employees to utilise any accrued time-in-lieu, annual \nleave, substitute leave, flexi-time credits or additional hours accrued under a \nflexible working arrangement \n\u2212 may require a minimum level of staffing to meet the operational requirements \nof the workplace. \n\u2022 If there are insufficient expressions of interest from relevant employees to give effect to the \nclosedown period, the following process will be applied: \n\u2212 the work unit manager may direct an employee who has excessive recreation \nleave (more than eight weeks or two years accruals), to take recreation leave \nduring the closedown period \n\u2212 the work unit manager may then direct an employee with accrued time-in-lieu, \nflexi-time credits or substitute leave to take that leave during the closedown \nperiod. \n\u2022 The work unit manager will provide at least four weeks\u2019 notice of any direction to take leave. \n \n6. Working-from-home \n6.1 Overview \nVictoria Police aims  to provide emplo yment options to maximise workforce flexibility and \npromote a balance between optimal service delivery and employees\u2019 personal commitments.  \n\u2022 Victoria Police will be fair and transparent in considering requests by employees to work-\nfrom-home. \n\u2022 Employees granted approval to work-from-home will continue to be provided w ith equal \nopportunities in their employment. \n\u2022 Individual working-from-home arrangements may be permitted on an ad-hoc or short-term \nbasis and will be assessed regularly, having regard to both empl oyees\u2019 personal \nresponsibilities and organisational needs. \n\u2022 Employees are not to undertake work -at-home unless they have obtained approval i n \naccordance with this policy. \n6.2 Definitions \nHome-based-work (HBW) location: the area designated by the employee within  their home \nas the work location in which they will perform their home-based-work.

Consultation \nbetween the employee and manager should occur and any reasonable workplace \nadjustments required should be discussed. Applications will be assessed on a case by case \nbasis and approval is at the discretion of management. \n\u2022 Accountability for considering home-based-work applications remains with the approving \nlocation with final sign off required by WRD.  \nEmployee responsibilities \nIn all cases where an employee submits a request  for home-based-work, consultation must \noccur between the employee and their manager as far in advance of the desired implementation \nof the requested change as possible to allow due consideration of th e request . It is the \nemployee\u2019s responsibility to ensure that:  \n\u2022 their manager receives their written request in a timely manner \n\u2022 they complete required forms and supply any supporting documentation for the application \nsuch as medical reports, details of car er or parental responsibilities, and any other \ninformation that will assist management consideration of the application \n\u2022 to provide their manager with sufficient information to reasonably consider their request \n\u2022 any changes in circumstances for the applicati on are advised to their manager as soon as \npossible. \nManager responsibilities \nIn considering requests by employees to work-from-home, the manager must take into account \nany relevant factors before providing the employee with a final decision.

Victoria Police recognises the importance of promoting diversity, \ngender equity and access to more flexible working arrangement options to assist employees in \nachieving an appropriate balance between organisational requirements and family and personal \ncommitments, as well as to give employees a meaningful level of control over when, where and how \nwork is accomplished.  Along with reasonable workplace adjustments, flexible work options  include: \npart-time employment, support while pregnant in the workplace  and upon return to the workplace \nfollowing the birth of a child, hours of work and flexi-time, variations to rostering, working from alternate \nlocations, and supplementary duties. Other flexible options are available to Victoria Police employees \nsuch as: cashing out of Accrued Time Off, deferred salary scheme, purchased leave, study leave, \nvoluntary duties and the transfer from one location to another. \nAs an equal opportunity employer, Victoria Police is committed to employment practices and standards \nthat are fair and equitable. Our employment standards are consistent with the obligations found within \nanti-discrimination legislation at Federal and State level, including the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 \n(Cth), Age Discrimination Act 2004 (Cth) and the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic), as well as, the Public \nAdministration Act 2004  and the Victoria Police Act 2013 .

This means the organisation and its employees are obliged to take steps \nto prevent discriminatory practices or behaviours, not just respond to issues or complaints of \ndiscrimination when they occur. \nTo meet this requirement:  \n\u2022 As an employer, Victoria Police maintains a w orkplace that values the diversity and \nindividuality of its employees and encourages a workplace that is inclusive, respectful and \nfair;  \n\u2022 As an employer, Victoria Police must exer cise positive duty to accommodate reasonable \nworkplace adjustments so that a person with disability can have equality of access, \nemployment and advancement opportunities (as per VPM Reasonable workplace \nadjustment); \n\u2022 All Victoria Police employees and others  covered by this policy are expected to exercise \ntheir positive duty by preve nting discriminatory practices and encourage behaviours that \ntreat others with dignity, courtesy and respect; and  \n\u2022 Policy owners must exercise positive duty by taking the necessary steps to eliminate barriers \nto equal opportunity when reviewing or developing systems, policy, training, infrastructure \nand equipment in their portfolio.  \nPositive duty refers to the duty of employers under Part 3 of the Equal Opportunity Act to take positive \naction to eliminate discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation. \n \nPolicy \nVictoria Police is committed  to providing flexible work options to assist employees to achieve an \nappropriate work/life balance, adopting the Victorian Government\u2019s commitment embedding flexible \nwork in the Victorian Public Service with the starting point that all roles can have some type of flexibility, \nbut not all types of flexibility will work for every role, and the three day a week default in a primary work \nlocation for full time employees as an initial point for flexible work conversations ( refer to the VPS \nEmployees \u2013 Flexible Working Arrangements Guideline for more information) . As such Victoria Police \nprovides its employees with flexibility in working arrangements , where it can reasonably be \naccommodated, taking into account the employee\u2019s family and carer responsibilities, disability, religion \nand culture. This applies to all LGBTIQ employees and family structures such as same sex coupled \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nparents, single parents et c. Work unit managers are expected to consider and apply th is policy when \nmanaging their workplaces. \nWorkplace flexibility represents cooperation and genuine commitment between employer and \nemployee for mutual benefit. Whilst not all forms of flexibility will be suitable for all roles at particular \ntimes or under particular circums tances due to the nature of Victoria Police\u2019s b usiness and having to \nmatch resourcing to demands , genuine consideration must be given to  the employee\u2019s needs  and \ncircumstances, alongside service delivery, rostering requirements, and corporate responsibility. This may \nrequire additional discussion with the employee to reach agreement on an alternative proposal that \naccommodates the employee\u2019s circumstances and still meets the needs of the local unit. Victoria Police \nnotes that flexib le work practices  also assist in attraction and retention  and contribute to increased \nproductivity and efficiency of employees. \nIn accordance with legislation and the principles of merit and equity, Victoria Police applies a standard \nof \u2018equitable\u2019, rather than a standard of the \u2018same\u2019. \n \n1.

Pregnancy in the workplace \n2.1 Overview \n\u2022 Victoria Police is committed to providing and maintaining a working environment for all \npregnant employees that is safe and without risks to health.  \n\u2022 So far as is reasonably practical, pregnant employees will be provided with t he option to \nundertake alternative duties where there is risk to the pregnant employee, their pregnancy, \ncolleagues and/or members of the public if they continue their usual role.    \n\u2022 Denying or limiting access to promotion, secondment, temporary duties, tr ansfers or \ntraining on the basis of pregnancy, or potential pregnancy is discrimination and/or adverse \naction and employees must not be denied or limited access to these opportunities or to \nany other benefits connected with their employment.  \n2.2 Definitions \nRegistered Medical Practitioner:  means a  registered Doctor of Medicine and includes \nspecialists such as an Obstetrician.  \n2.3 Notification and risk assessment \nOnce pregnant, some aspects of an employee\u2019s role may pose risks to the employee and their \npregnancy. For this reason, pregnant employees are encouraged to notify their manager of their \npregnancy as soon as practicable, taking into consideration that some roles will pose higher \nhealth and safety risks to the employee and their pregnancy than o thers. An employee must \nprovide at least 10 weeks written notice of the intention to take parental leave, including the \nproposed start and end dates and the expected  due date . Notification should include a \nconfinement certificate from a Registered Medical Practitioner confirming the pregnancy and \nexpected due date.   \nThe manager is to ensure that the notification of pregnancy is treated confidentially and is \nrespectful of the pregnant employee.   \nEarly notification will ensure that a risk assessment can be conducted to determine appropriate \nduties during the pregnancy to avoid placing the pregnant employee or their pregnancy at risk.  \nAn occupational  health and safety risk assessment of the employee\u2019s duties should be \nconducted by the manager, in consultation with the employee, and will be based on advice from \nthe employee\u2019s Registered Medical Practitioner. This will enable an informed decision to be \nmade based on the Registered Medical Practitioner\u2019s advice  regarding appropri ate duties \nduring the pregnancy taking into consideration identified risks in the wo rk environment. The \nemployee must provide the employer with a certificate from their Registered Medical \nPractitioner using the \u2018 Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019  \u2013 refer to \nVPM, \u201cHuman resource  management, Flexible work arrangements , Practitioner Guides and \nResources\u201d. \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n12 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nAny risk assessment must take into account the following:    \n\u2022 any potential risks to the health and safety of the pregnant employee and their pregnancy  \n\u2022 an OHS risk assessment of the work environment \n\u2022 the pregnant employee\u2019s preferences and circumstances including level of expertise \n\u2022 Operational Safety Tactics and Training (OSTT) requirements for operational duties \n\u2022 medical advice.   \nIt is the employee\u2019s responsibility to provide their Registered Medical Practitioner with a copy \nof the \u2018Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019 for them to complete.  \nIn consultation with their manager, an employee will be required to complete the \u2018Workplace \nSupport Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in Touch, and Return to Work from Parental Leave\u2019. The plan is \nintended to support employees and their managers through the process. \nFor further guidance on the workplace risk assessment and the \u2018Medical Information Pack and \nCertification Form\u2019 also refer to the \u2018Pregnancy in the Workplace and Return to Work after \nParental Leave Guide\u2019, this can be found on VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Flexible work \narrangements, Practitioner Guides and Resources\u201d. \n2.4 Duties during pregnancy \n\u2022 Appropriate duties that have b een determined, and as agreed between the manager and \nthe employee, must be recorded on the \u2018Workplace Support Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in \nTouch, and Return to Work from Parental Leave\u2019.  \n\u2022 If the work duties that have been agreed to, for the period of pregnanc y, differ from the \nemployee\u2019s substantive position, the employee will continue to own and occupy their \nsubstantive position whilst performing the temporary duties. The employee will continue to \nreceive remuneration at their substantive rank/classification.  \n\u2022 Duties undertaken by a pregnant employee must be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure \nthat they do not expose the employee to unnecessary risk. This review might inform further \nchanges to the duties which can be safely perf ormed. The employee must notif y their \nregistered medical practitioner and their manager of any developments in the pregnancy \nthat may present as a health risk so that appropriate adjustments to duties can be made.   \n\u2022 Refer to section 2.5 for information on transfer to a safe job. \nHigher duties \n\u2022 Where a pregnant employee is undertaking a higher duties assignment but, due to the \npregnancy cannot perform all of the duties of that assignment, and alternative duties or \nreasonable adjustments to work responsibilities at the higher rank/classification cannot be \naccommodated, the employee will no longer be eligible for the full higher duties allowance \nand will revert to their substantive position.  \n\u2022 For VPS employees, if the pregnant employee undertakes part of the duties of a higher \nclassified position, the level of the allowance shall be in proportion to the extent of the \nhigher duties being performed  (refer to VPM Remuneration for more information on \nhigher duties). \n\u2022 When considering the above, it should be reme mbered that it is unlawful to discri minate \nbased on pregnancy. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n13 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nShift work \nFollowing the risk assessment the employee may be exempt from shift work or night shift where, \non the basis of the risk assessment (and/or advice from a Registered Medical Practitioner) it is \ndetermined that there are additional risks to the employee\u2019s safety during those shifts or where \na medical certificate accompanies the request.  \nOperational Safety and Tactics Training (OSTT)/Operational and Promotional Training \n\u2022 A decision regarding the completion of OSTT or other operational and promotional training \nduring pregnancy is one that the employee should only make following considerat ion of \nthe information provided in the \u2018Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019, and must \nbe consistent with advice provided by the ir medical practitioner. Pregnant employees \nwanting to undertake OSTT or other operational and promotion training must discuss the \nrisks associated with the training with their medical practitioner and obtain medical \nclearance to do so.   \n\u2022 For the avoidance  of doubt, pregnant employees can be selected for promotions with a \nphysical component. This component may be completed  upon the selectee\u2019s return to \noperational duties from parental leave. \n2.5 Entitlements during pregnancy \nDress for police members \n\u2022 Where the member\u2019s uniform can no longer be worn comfortably due to their pregnancy, \nthe member will be permitted to wear plain (professional) clothes.  \n\u2022 Pregnant members performing duties in plain clothes are entitled to receive a temporary \ncivilian clothing allowance. \nTransfer to a safe job  \n\u2022 Where an employee is pregnant and, in the opinion of a Registered Medical Practitioner, is \nfit for work, but it is inadvisable for them to continue at their present work because of illness \nor risks arising out of their pregnancy or hazards connected with the work assigned to the \nemployee, the employee will be transferred, if reasonably practicable, to an appropriate safe \njob for the risk period.    \n\u2022 The safe job may involve working from a different location  or may mean modifying th e \nemployee's existing role to remove any identified risks. This will depend on the result of the \nrisk assessment and opinion of the medical practitioner. \n\u2022 The safe job must involve meaningful duties  and be commensurate with the employee\u2019s \nskills, training and experience. This may include undertaking work from another work unit \nor the employee working from an alternative work location for a specific period or the \nduration of the pregnancy.  \n\u2022 The safe job will not alter the employee\u2019s terms and conditions of em ployment. The \nemployee will have the same ordinary hours of work as the employee\u2019s present position; or \na different number of ordinary hours as agreed by the employee and employer.   \n\u2022 Where an employee reduces their hours to better cope with their pregnancy , any  paid \nparental leave subsequently taken will be paid at the rate of pay applicable prior th e \nreduction in ordinary hours.  \n\u2022 If a transfer to an appropriate safe job is not reasonably practicable, the employee may \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n14 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nelect, or the employer may require the employee to commence paid no safe job leave for \nsuch period as is certified necessary by a Registered Medical Practitioner or until the end of \nthe pregnancy. \n2.6 Leave \nLeave, including pre-natal leave and assisted reproductive leave, is granted in accordance with \nthe VPM Leave. \n \n3. Lactation breaks \n3.1 Principles \nVictoria Police is committed to fostering a supportive work environment for empl oyees who \nchoose to breastfeed by: \n\u2022 providing appropriate workplace facilities for employees who choose to express breast milk \nor breastfeed their child \n\u2022 providing paid lactation breaks during work hours \n\u2022 ensuring all employees\u2019 awareness of breastfeeding policies and facilities \n\u2022 seeking to eliminate any unlawful direct and/or  indirect discrimination on the grounds of \nbreastfeeding. \nEmployees who choose to breastfeed should be supported in that choice and treated with \ndignity and respect in the workplace. \n3.2 Definitions \nBreastfeeding: for the purpose of this policy, this includes the physiological process of milk \nbeing produced to breastfeed or express breast milk for an infant or young child.  \nCaregiver: a caregiver is a person who assumes responsibility for bringing an infant or young \nchild onto Victoria Police premises with the intent of delivering the infant or young child to an \nemployee for the purpose of breastfeeding. \nLactation breaks: paid breaks taken by an employee in consultation with their employer for \nthe sole purpose of enabling an employee to express breast milk or breastfeed an infant or \nyoung child off site or at the workplace. \nChild: generally refers to a child up to school age; however consideration should be given to \nemployee\u2019s individual circumstances and needs for breastfeeding a child. \n3.3 Breastfeeding facilities \n\u2022 Workplace facilities should be provided, where practical, for  employees who choose to \nexpress breast milk or breastfeed their child during work hours. \n\u2022 Facilities should be accessible for all, in terms of space, location and security access.  \n\u2022 The minimum requirements for an appropriate workplace facility include, as far as  \npracticable: \n\u2212 a private, clean and hygienic space/room which is suitably signed and lockable \n\u2212 appropriate seating, a table or bench to support breastfeeding (and breastfeeding \nequipment) \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n15 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2212 suitable storage area for any equipment and/or electric breastfeeding equipment \n\u2212 a power point for breast pumps and other equipment \n\u2212 access in the workplace, to a refrigerator/freezer for storing milk and a microwave \n\u2212 access to a sink near the private space/room with hot water for washing hands and \nequipment \n\u2212 nappy change table                       \n\u2212 an appropriate receptacle for rubbish and nappy disposal.   \n\u2022 It is not appropriate for employees to breastfeed or express breast milk in toilet facilities, \nnor is it an appropriate location for equipment to be cleaned. Sinks and refrigeration located \nin a staffroom or kitchen facility should be used. Refer to the Australian Breastfeeding \nAssociation website for guidance on storage of expressed milk, if required.   \n\u2022 Generally, workplace facilities should be u sed, however consideration should be given to \nallowing the employee to go home, to a caregiver\u2019s home or accessing a childcare centre if \nrequested.  Requests should be assessed on a case by case basis. \n3.4 Lactation breaks \nThe frequency, duration and timing of lactation breaks: \n\u2022 should be determined through consultation between the employee and their manager to \nallow the flexibility needed to breastfeed or express milk \n\u2022 will vary between individuals and may be influenced by factors including the child\u2019s age, \nfeeding habits, the location of the breastfeeding room and any special requirements  \n\u2022 will likely reduce in frequency and increase in flexibility for scheduling around operational \nneeds over time . Police employees are entitled to up to one hour lactation break(s) per \neight hour shift, with these breaks being in addition to rest periods and meal breaks. The \none hour lactation break for each shift may be utilised through multiple short breaks if the \nemployee prefers.  VPS employees are entitled to reasonable time during working hours. \nThe employee\u2019s individual circumstances and needs should be taken into consideration \n\u2022 are to be documented in a \u2018Lactation Breaks Plan\u2019, which should be reviewed on a regular \nbasis \u2013 refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource  management, Flexible work arrangements , \nPractitioner Guides and Resources\u201d.  A copy of the agreement should be retained by each \nparty \n\u2022 should be timed where possible to consider reasonable business and organisational needs \nwith a focus on supporting employee health, while minimising disruption to the workplace \nand service delivery.

Part-time Employment \n4.1 Objectives \n\u2022 All part-time work arrangements should take into consider ation any relevant operational \nand service delivery requirements, rostering principles and the employee\u2019s individual \ncircumstances.  \n\u2022 Part-time employees will have the same opportunities as other employees in all aspects of \nemployment, including access to t raining, professional development, assignments and \npromotion.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n17 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n4.2 Definitions \nThe definitions outlined in section 1.2 of this policy apply to this section. \n4.3 Part-time employment \n\u2022 An employee may work on a part-time basis where the employee has been selected for a \npart-time position which was advertised (employer initiated), or the employee has applied \nand been approved to convert their existing position to part-time (employee initiated). \nEmployee initiated also applies where a position has been advertised as ful l-time, but an \nemployee has elected to do this role on a part-time basis.  \n\u2022 Part-time positions can also be filled with the expression of interest transfer process, see \nsection 1.14. \n\u2022 This procedure does not apply to employees being  rehabilitated under WorkCover ( see \nVPM Management and return to work of ill/injured employees) or where an employee \nworks on a part-time basis pursuant to a flexible working arrangement. \n\u2022 The ordinary hours of work must be contained in a written agreement signed by the \nemployee and the employer and will include a set number of days or a set number of hours \nof work (or both) over an agreed period. \n4.4 Employer initiated: advertised part-time positions \nA part-time position may be advertised where there is a vacant part-time position, a new part-\ntime position has been created or a vacant position has been converted to part-time at the \nnomination of the employer.  \nEligibility  \nVPS Employees \n\u2022 All employees are eligible to apply for part-time employment.  \n\u2022 In addition, to assist a VPS employee in reconciling work and parental responsibilities, they \nmay request to return to work from parental leave at a reduced time-fraction until their \nchild reaches school age, after which they will have a right to resume their pre-parental \nleave substantive time-fraction.  \nPolice members \n\u2022 All members are eligible to apply for part-time employment subject to the below time in \nposition exceptions.  \n\u2022 Time in position requirements do not prevent a police member from applying for an \nadvertised part-time position except where:  \n\u2212 the member owns a special category or priority status position; or  \n\u2212 the new position involves the same hours of work as the member\u2019s current position \nand it would be the only position occupied by the member.  \n\u2022 Advertisements for part-time positions must specify the number of fortnightly hours  and \nmay specify a proposed pattern of hours.  \n\u2022 An advertised part-time position must have identical qualifications to the full-time \nequivalent position, including OSTT.  \n\u2022 Appointment to a n advertised part-time position is subject to the member and the \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n18 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nemployer reaching agreement on a work pattern and completing  and submitting an  \n\u2018Application for  a Part-time Arrangement/Application to Vary Existing Part-time \nArrangement\u2019 \u2013 apply through HR Assist, Employee Self Service, Status Change. \n4.5 Employee initiated: applications for and variations to part-time employment, or changes \nto ordinary rostering arrangements \nEligibility rules and procedures are set out in the Workplace Flexibility section.  \nWork pattern  \nPolice members \n\u2022 Any reduction from the standard hours of workplace must be at the initiation of the \nemployee. Ordinary hours of work for each rostered shift must be continuous. \n\u2022 Hours of work for part-time members can be structured different ways including:  \n\u2212 set start and finishing times on each day; and/or \n\u2212 a number of hours and days over a specified period. \n\u2022 Part-time arrangements should be in writing and provide for the set days or set hours of \nwork (or both) or an agreed number of hours and days to be worked flexibly. This means \nthat a process can be included in a part-time arrangement, which sets out parameters for \nany alteration to the pattern of the hours on a fortnightly basis . This is  with a view to \nmeeting the employe e\u2019s work/life balance while taking into account the operational \nrequirements of the employer. Any such provision must be recorded in a written application \nfor a flexible work arrangement, or application to vary an existing flexible work \narrangement.  \n\u2022 The pattern of hours of a part-time member may vary from the standard roster at a work \narea only with the agreement of the employer.  \n\u2022 Where possible, shift lengths should be the same as the shift lengths at the station to which \nthe member is attached. However, a shorter or longer shift length can be agreed if it suits \nthe needs of the member and the workplace, the minimum shift duration is four hours.  \nVPS employees \n\u2022 Hours of work must include an agreed number of hours and days over a specified period. \n\u2022 Unless the employee is a shift worker, part-time hours of work must be rostered within the \nordinary span of hours of 7am  to 7pm Monday to Friday . An exception to this is if an \nemployee and their employer enter into an individual flexibility arrangement to meet the \ngenuine needs of both parties. Such an individual flexibility arrangement that includes hours \nof work outside of the ordinary span of hours must be in writing and signed by both the \nemployee and their employer  (the delegate for approval of the ind ividual flexibility \narrangement is the Director, Recruitment, Deployment and Workplace Relations Division).  \n\u2022 Employees must not work less than three consecutive hours on a w orking day, except in \nexceptional circumstances by agreement with the employer.  \nVariations to part-time arrangements  \n\u2022 Workplace reviews can occur at any time, however it is advised that a review of the \nemployee\u2019s part-time arrangement should be conducted at least every 12 months, where \npractical, in order to assess whether the arrangement continues to meet the needs of both \nparties.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n19 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 If a VPS employee changes their work location, they will be required to submit a new part-\ntime application form through HR Assist, Employee Self Service, Status Change in order to \nhave their arrangement administratively carried over to the new location. A police employee \nwho changes work location will have their flexible working arrangement continue at the \nnew location unless it will result in significant loss of productivity or efficiency which is likely \nto have a negative impact on police service delivery. \n\u2022 Any review of a part-time arrangement should have regard to the individual circumstances \nof the employee, including, where relevant, the child care requirements of that employee. \nReviews of part-time arrangements must also take into account any requirements contained \nin the Fair Work Act, the Equal Opportunity Act and the criteria stipulated in the Workplace \nFlexibility section of this policy.   \n\u2022 Part-time working arrangements may be varied in writing between the employee and the \nemployer in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Workplace Flexibility section. \nAny review should be documented and retained on the employee's file. \n\u2022 Temporary variations to agreed/rostered hours of duty of part-time employees may occur \nat any time following discussion and mutual agreement between the empl oyee and the \nemployer.  \nPolice members \nWhere the employer proposes to vary an existing part-time arrangement that does not form \npart of a FWA and agreement cannot be reached, the employer may, upon the provision of six \nmonths\u2019 notice or a longer period as is reasonable having regard to the employee\u2019s personal \ncircumstances, vary the employee\u2019s pattern of hours.   \nDirected shift changes \n\u2022 Directed changes to shifts of part-time employees should only be considered in exceptional \noperational circumstances including when no other alternatives are available. The employer \nis to consider an employee\u2019s individual circumstances before directing a temporary change \nto the shifts of a part-time employee.  \n\u2022 Where a directed ch ange has occurred, payments will apply in accordance with the \nenterprise agreements. \n\u2022 In certain circumstances where the employer has directed a change to an employee\u2019s shift, \nthe employer may be required to pay child care expenses. Childcare entitlements an d \nexpenses apply as per the applicable enterprise agreement for VPS employees and police \nmembers. \nPolice members \n\u2022 Where the member\u2019s rostered shift is changed without the member\u2019s consent and 72 hours \nor less notice is given, the change of shift penalty will apply.  \n\u2022 Change of shift penalty is an additional amount of 25% of an employee\u2019s base hourly rate \nof pay for the duration of the changed shift. This penalty will not apply during a period \nwhere overtime is payable. \n\u2022 Part-time police members should not normally be required to be available for resumption \nof duty unless included in the \u2018Application for a Part-time Arrangement/Application to Vary \nExisting Part-time Arrangement\u2019 form.

At management discretion, hours available within \nthe Police Service Area, Division, Region, Command or Department, in which the employee \nis located may be utilised.  \n\u2022 Employees are not precluded from  accepting different duties and/or a lesser \nrank/classification in order to return to full-time employment (this will mean being paid at \nthat rank/classification). \n4.6 Conditions of employment \nProvisions relating to salary, leave and all entitlement s are outlined in the relevant enterprise \nagreement.  \nAllowances  \nPolice members  \n\u2022 Are entitled to pro rata amounts for the uniform and civilian clothing allowances and \ncommuted overtime allowance.  \nLeave  \n\u2022 Working part-time will impact the payment of long service leave - refer to the VPM Leave.   \n\u2022 Accrual of recreation and personal and carers leave will be on a pro-rata basis. \n\u2022 Police members who work part-time (including those who own/occupy multiple part-time \npositions) are not eligible for accrued time off.   \n\u2022 Prenatal leave is not impacted by working part-time. \nOvertime  \nAn employee may be required to work reasonable overtime in accordance with the provisions \nof the applicable enterprise agreements.  \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n21 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nPolice Members \nOvertime will be paid for hours worked outside the ordinary hours specified in the member\u2019s \npart-time agreement at the rates contained in their enterprise agreement; or the member may \nelect to take time off in lieu under the enterprise agreement. This provision also applies for any \nattendance at training.    \nVPS employees \nOther than shift workers, additional hours up to and including 38 hours per week will be paid \nat the ordinary hourly rate of pay. Hours directed by the employer and in excess of 38 hours \nper week will be paid at the overtime rates specified in their enterprise agreement. \nAssignments and temporary duties  \n\u2022 Victoria Police\u2019s recruitment, allocation, assignment, transfer and promotion processes are \nconducted in a manner that provides fair and equitable opportunity to all employees. \n\u2022 Part-time employees may be assigned to other positions or duties, either full-time or part-\ntime, in accordance with the assignment process. Part-time employees will have the same \nopportunity for higher duties, temporary duties and assignments as other full -time \nemployees. Refusing a par t-time employee\u2019s application for these opportunities is \ndiscrimination. \n\u2022 Higher duties assignments may be shared  by two part-time employees, if applicable. See \nVPM Remuneration for more details.  \n\u2022 Where the assignment is \u2018directed\u2019, the employee\u2019s existing working pattern remains unless \notherwise agreed.  \n\u2022 Where a part-time employee applies for an assignment with full-time or increased hours to \ntheir normal working pattern, if it is agreed that the part -time hours can be worked, the \nworking pattern arrangement for the higher duties or assignment period should be \ndocumented on the Employee Self Service, Status Change section of HR Assist.  \n\u2022 Where a part-time police member is assigned to  a part-time position, or to a full-time \nposition on a part-time basis, they may, by request and with the agreement of the employer, \ncontinue to perform the duties of their own position while assigned to another position, as \nlong as their sum of rostered h ours does not exceed 76 hours per fortnight. A part-time \nworking pattern agreement for the assignment position should be documented and signed \nby both parties.   \nSurplus employees \nIf a part-time position is abolished, the emplo yee is declared surplus and i s placed under the \nprovisions of 306-11 Redeployment (VPS) or VPM Mobility and redeployment ( police \nmembers). Where a part-time position is not available, surplus staff will be matched to \nappropriate full-time position in consultation with the employee. The employee may apply for \nthe position, to which they are matched, to be converted to part-time in accordance with section \n4.5 above.   \nSuperannuation \nPart-time employment has implications for superannuation. Employees should seek \nsuperannuation advice from their fund before finalising their part-time arrangements.  \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n22 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nAttendance at training \nAlternative methods of delivery of training will be considered to maximise opportunities for all \nemployees to access training.    \n4.7 Owning/occupying two part-time positions \n\u2022 An employee may own/occupy two part-time positions at the same level/rank, and at the \nsame or different locations, provided that the sum of hours per fortnight does not exceed \n76 hours per fortnight. Employees wh o own/occupy two part-time positions must ensure \nthat the hours for each position are compatible. The member must communicate with each \nauthorised delegate separately concerning any changes that may impact on either position. \nThis includes the impact of attendance at training.    \n\u2022 When making decisio ns in relation to one of the positions the employee occupies, the \nauthorised delegate must consult with the authorised delegate of the other position \noccupied by the employee.  \n\u2022 Examples of the types of decisions that authorised delegates should consult over are:  \n\u2212 a direction to work overtime (to ensure that hours of both positions are taken into \nconsideration)  \n\u2212 approval of assignment or higher duties \n\u2212 the requirement to undertake compulsory training.     \nTime in position \u2013 police members \nWhen a police member occupies two part-time positions, time in position dates are the dates \nfor each individual position.  \nRate of pay \nThe employee shall receive salaries, entitlements and allowances, as provided by the relevant  \nenterprise agreement,  on a pro -rata basis for t he total number of hours worked in both \npositions.  \nPromotion or reversion \u2013 police members \nWhen the member\u2019s rank changes (promotion or reversion) the member wil l be unattached \nfrom all positions at the previous rank.  \nWorkCover  \nWorkCover responsibilities are to be managed by the workplace in which the injury occurred. If \nit is not known when or where the injury occurred (e.g.: injury occurring over a period of time), \nthen the claim should be managed by the workplace where the employee was located when \nthe claim was lodged.  \nRelinquishing a position  \nThe employee may vacate one of the owned positions at any time in order to revert to owning \nonly one part-time position. Where this occurs for police members, the member must not apply \nfor an additional part-time position which involves the same hours as the relinquished position \nuntil the balance of the time in position requirements of the relinquished position have been \nmet.   \n4.8 Residual hours  \nManagement may consider using residual part-time hours to create an d advertise additional \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n23 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \npart-time positions within their Police Service Area, Division, Region, Command or Department \nin order to fulfil the requirements of part of a role or fraction of unit. \nHowever, managers need to be mindful that surplus part-time hours (e.g. arising from requests \nby employees who have bee n on parental leave to return to work on a part -time basis) are \nbeing managed appropriately . These hours must not be used to create new permanent \npositions that would prevent an employee on flexible arrangements from returning to full-time \nhours.  \nThe reason for this is to assist an employee in reconciling work and parental responsibilities, \nemployees have the right to request to return to work at a reduced time-fraction until the child, \nor the youngest  child, reaches school age, after which the employee will resume th eir \nsubstantive time-fraction or make application to work part-time as a flexible work arrangement, \nthis can be a permanent or temporary part-time arrangement.  \nDuring this time, the employee is on a temporary part-time agreement and the residual hours \n(FTE) either need to be quarantined or guaranteed to be restored on resumption of the \nemployee\u2019s pre parental leave hours (FTE).   \n \n5. Flexi-time (VPS employees only) \n5.1 Purpose \nVictoria Police is committed to providing flexibility in the workplace that takes into account the \nwork requirements of the organisation and the personal  and/or family circumstances of the \nemployee.  \n5.2 Flexi-time \n\u2022 An employee can work and accumulate flexi-time by agreement between the employer and \nemployee: \n\u2212 where the manager is satisfied that there is sufficient work to be performed; and  \n\u2212 where required, a sufficient level of supervision is available.  \n\u2022 Flexi-time must be negotiated within the normal span of hours between 7:00am a nd \n7:00pm, Monday to Friday. Unless the employee and their manager have en tered into an \nIFA, any work performed outside of these hours is considered to be overtime. If  entering \ninto an IFA, contact Workplace Relations. \n\u2022 Flexi-time is to be taken at a time m utually agreed to between the employee and the \nmanager. \n\u2022 Flexi-time is not generally available to police members, shift workers, causal employees or \nVPSG-5 and above (and Forensic Officer equivalent), particularly those in management or \nsupervisory roles wh ere business continuity would be adversely affected by flexi -time \narrangements. In exceptional circumstances however, an individual arrangement ma y be \nreached between the parties.  \n\u2022 Where it is determined that the accrual of flexi-time no longer meets the needs of the work \nunit, the manager is required to consult with the relevant employees and the relevant union \nin accordance with the \u2018Implementatio n of change\u2019 provisions of the relevant enterprise \nagreement. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n24 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n5.3 Flexi-credit \n\u2022 Unless exceptional circumstances exist, and approval is provided by the manager to carry a \ngreater accrual, the maximum amount of flexi-time credit allowed for a full-time employee \nis 15.2 hours, and for a part-time employee is the equivalent of two days of their part-time \nwork pattern.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has flexi-time credit in excess of the allowable limit, the manager may \ndirect the employee to take the excess hours, un less the f lexi-time credit is to cover a \nChristmas Closedown period in accordance with section 5.6 of this policy.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has flexi-time credit excess and exceptional circumstances exist, a level \n2 delegate may approve for outstanding credits to be paid out to the employee at their \nordinary hourly rate of pay. \n\u2022 Where an employee does not use all of their flexi -credit prior to the cessation of their \nemployment with Victoria Police, they will be entitled to have any outstanding credits paid \nout to them at their ordinary hourly rate of pay.  \n5.4 Flexi-debit \n\u2022 In exceptional circumstances, an employee may take flexi-time without the necessary flexi-\ncredit being accrued. This can only occur with prior approval from the manager and must \nnot result in a full-time employee having a negative balance that exceeds -7.6 (negative) \nhours for a full-time employee or that exceeds -1 (negative) day for a part-time employee. \n\u2022 If an employee has an excess flexi-debit and does not reduce the debit within a reasonable \nperiod as specified by the manager, the employee must elect to utilise either recreation \nleave or leave without pay to recoup the debit.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has a flexi-debit on cessation of employment, money or leave owed by \nthe employee to the employer will be debited accordingly, at their ordinary hourly rate of \npay in accordance with the Financial Management Act 1994 (Vic), except where the cessation \nis due to death.   \n5.5 Taking flexi-time \n\u2022 Flexi-time must only be taken with prior approval from the employee\u2019s manager. In making \nany assessment as to when flexi-time can be taken, the manager will give full consideration \nto the employee\u2019s preferences; however, it may not always be possible for the employee to \ntake flexi-time on their nominated day due to the service delivery requirements of the work \nunit.  \n\u2022 Flexi-time should be taken as a full or half day based on the employee\u2019s ordinary hours of \nwork. At the discretion of the manager, approval may be given to an employee to take flexi-\nleave in hours.  \n5.6 Christmas closedown \n\u2022 Where a work unit manager intends to closedown part or all of the unit\u2019s operations for the \nthree working days from the first working day after Christmas Day to the end of the last  \nworking day before New Year\u2019s Day (1 January) (closedown period), the work unit manager: \n\u2212 will notify relevant employees in writing of this intention no later than 1 October of \nthe year in which the closedown is to take place \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n25 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2212 will request relevant employees to utilise any accrued time-in-lieu, annual leave, \nsubstitute leave, flexi-time credits or additional hours accrued under a flexible working \narrangement \n\u2212 may require a minimum level of staffing to meet the operational requirements of the \nworkplace. \n\u2022 If there are insufficient expressions of interest from relevant employees to give effect to the \nclosedown period, the following process will be applied: \n\u2212 the work unit manager may direct an employee who has excessive recreation leave \n(more than eight weeks or two years accruals), to take recreation leave during the \nclosedown period \n\u2212 the work unit manager may then direct an employee with accrued time-in-lieu, flexi-\ntime credits or substitute leave to take that leave during the closedown period. \n\u2022 The work unit manager will provide at least four weeks\u2019 notice of any direction to take leave. \n \n6. Working-from-home and working remotely \n6.1 Overview \nVictoria Police aims to provide employment options to maximise workfor ce flexibility and \npromote a balance between optimal service delivery and employees\u2019 personal commitments.  \n\u2022 Victoria Police will be fair and transparent i n considering requests by employees to work \nremotely or work-from-home. \n\u2022 Employees granted approval to work remotely or from home will continue to be provided \nwith equal opportunities in their employment. \n\u2022 Individual working-from-home or remote work arrangements may be permitted on an ad-\nhoc or short-term basis or on a more regular basis in line with other flexible arrangement \nrequests and will be reviewed regularly, having regard to both employees\u2019 personal \nresponsibilities and organisational needs. \n\u2022 Employees are not to undertake remote of home-based work unless they have obtained \napproval in accordance with this policy. \n\u2022 Where a State of Emergency or State of Disaster is declared, Victoria Police may issue other \nguidance which may supersede this policy in instances of differing information.   \n6.2 Definitions \nHome-based-work (HBW) location: the area designated by the employee within their home \nas the work location in which they will perform their home-based-work. This includes areas the \nemployee accesses in their home when taking breaks; such as the kitchen, bathroo m, \npassageways and staircases. \nHome-based-work (HBW) arrangement: a flexible work arrangement that may be authorised \non a short-term basis to help accommodate employees\u2019 occasional and intermittent personal \ncommitments, and emergencies or on a more regular basis to assist  with an employee\u2019s \npersonal commitments and to help achieve an appropriate work/life balance.  \nRemote work: refers to a location that the employee has requested to work from that is not \nthe employee\u2019s home and may be an interstate or overseas location.   \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n26 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nRemote work arrangement: a flexible arrangement that may be authorised, on a short -term \nbasis only, where the employee will be working from another location, other than their home, \nthat may be an interstate or overseas location.  \n6.3 Eligibility \nAll employees other than recruits, probationary constables and VPS employees who are within \ntheir probationary period are eligible to apply to work-from-home or work  remotely. Any \nexception to this will only be considered in exceptional circumstances or as part of a reasonable \nworkplace adjustment for a current or prospective employee with disability. \nApplications for a remote  work arrangement from an interstate or overseas location will be \nconsidered on a case by case basis only and several factors will need to be considered, including \nthe role performe d and whether the role can be performed remotely or not. Relevant \nconsiderations are outlined throughout this section.  \nVPS employees can have a starting point for conversations around working from home or \nworking remotely as three days a week (for full ti me employees) from their primary work \nlocation (e.g. office), with the other two days being worked remotely or from home. This is not \ncompulsory and individual arrangements may vary depending on the organisational or \nemployee\u2019s needs. Refer to the VPS Employees \u2013 Flexible Working Arrangements Guideline for \nmore information.  \n6.4 Information management & security \nPolicy adherence \n\u2022 All Authorised Users have a duty and responsibility to ensure that Victoria Police \ninformation is protected from harm, unauthorised or inappropriate disclosure. \n\u2022 If Victoria Police employees have approval for a remote or HBW arrangement , they must \nensure that they continue to adhere to Victoria Police policy. This includes maintaining the \nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of Victoria Police information. \n\u2022 To ensure the security of Victoria Police information, Authorised Users who are not Victoria \nPolice employees are not to undertake work at home or remotely. \nRisks \nWorking-from-home increases the security risks for Victoria Police information including (but \nnot limited to): \n\u2022 the potential for people without a \u2018need -to-know\u2019 or without an appropriate security \nclearance to gain access to (or read) official information or other official resources \n\u2022 loss of Victoria Police information in transit between the workplace and home \n\u2022 viruses or other malicious code being present or being introduced to IT equipment.  \nRefer to the Protective Security Practice Guide \u2013 810 - Working from home securely for further \nguidance. \nSecurity classified information \n\u2022 Information that has been assessed as PROTECTED or above is not to be worked on using \nhome-based or remote  computer equipment, unless this is done on the Victoria Police \nnetwork through approved  secure two -factor authentication (such as Connect.Police \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n27 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \ntokens).  Refer t o VPM Information categorisation, collection and recording  for \ninformation on security classifications. \n\u2022 Hardcopy s ecurity classified information must be stored in a container suitable for the \nclassification of the material when not in use. Refer to Protective Security guide \u2013 G200 \u2013 \nAssessment and handling of Victoria Police information. If a suitable security container is \nnot available, then the information should not be taken home. \n\u2022 Any deviation from these requirements requires approval by  the Department Head after \nseeking advice from the Information Security Manager and the Protective Security Manager, \nInformation Security, Security and Management Services Division. \n6.5 Occupational health & safety \n\u2022 Victoria Police will provide and maintain, so  far as is reasonably practical, workplaces and \nworking environments that are safe and without risks to health for all employees a nd \nindividuals using Victoria Police premises, facilities or equipment. This applies to an \napproved remote or HBW location. \n\u2022 Employees granted approval to work remotely or work-from-home must comply with their \nobligations under the Victorian Occupational Health and Safety  Act 2004 and all relevant \nVictoria Police and WorkSafe occupational health and safety policies and procedures  and \ntake corrective action to eliminate all potential hazards within their remote or HBW location.  \nAny hazards which cannot be immediately corrected must be reported.  \n\u2022 Employees will be required to comply with all reasonable and lawful directions by Victoria \nPolice from time to time, including directions regarding safe work methods which may \nrequire employees to rearrange or alter the remote or HBW location. \n\u2022 Employees must report all work related health and safety concerns or incidents that occur \nat their remote or HBW location to Victoria Police as soon as is reasonably practicable. \n\u2022 Where a WorkCover claim is accepted for an injury that occurred at a remote work location, \nconsideration must be given for a return to work arrangement and how that could be \npractically implemented where the employee is working remotely (interstate or overseas).  \nThis may incur additional costs.  \n6.6 Applying \nApplication form \n\u2022 Employees applying for a remote work or HBW arrangement must complete an \u2018Application \nfor Home-based-work\u2019 (i ncluding an OH&S Self -Assessment Checklist for their home-\nbased-work location) and submit it to their line manager for consideration.  Consultation \nbetween the employee and manager should occur  and any reasonable workplace \nadjustments required should be discussed. Applications will be assessed on a case by case \nbasis and approval is at the discretion of management. \n\u2022 Accountability for considering remote or HBW applications remains with the appr oving \nlocation with final sign off required by Workplace Relations.  \n\u2022 Remote work arrangement applications must be approved by the Level 2 Delegate due to \nthe increased security risks and additional considerations associated with these requests. \nEmployee responsibilities \nIn all cases where an employee submits a request for remote or HBW, consultation must occur \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n28 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nbetween the employee and their manager as far in advance of the desired implementation of \nthe requested change as possible to allow due consideration of the request. It is the employee\u2019s \nresponsibility to ensure that:  \n\u2022 their manager receives their written request in a timely manner \n\u2022 they complete required forms and supply any supporting documentation for the application \nsuch as medical reports, details of carer or parental responsibilities, and any other \ninformation that will assist management consideration of the application \n\u2022 to provide their manager with sufficient information to reasonably consider their request \n\u2022 any changes in circumstances for the application are advised to their manager as soon as \npossible. \nManager responsibilities \nIn considering requests by employees to work-from-home or work remotely, the manager must \nconsider any relevant factors before providing the employee with a final decision. These may \ninclude: \n\u2022 compliance with all applicable legislation  (e.g. Equal Opportunity Act  and Disability \nDiscrimination Act and the Fair Work Act etc.)  \n\u2022 the nature of the responsibilities of the employee\u2019s position including supervision of other \nemployees, service response to other employees or the public, whether the e mployee \nrequires regular access to hard copy information and/or has access to sensitive or \nprotectively marked information \n\u2022 the nature of the employee\u2019s position and duties and whether any meetings, seminars, and \nconferences may be able to be facilitated remotely and/or online \n\u2022 whether the employee is fit for work, working-from-home is not a substitute for personal \nleave \n\u2022 whether the security risk of accessing Victoria Police information to enable an employee to \nwork remotely or work-from-home is too significant (refer to section 6.8 for more detailed \ninformation) \n\u2022 any security arrangements that an employee will need to comply with to enable a remote \nor home-based-work arrangement to be approved \n\u2022 whether the employee is in a position with specific liability considerations, for example legal \npositions. Remote work from an interstate or overseas location may have implications for \nthe individual\u2019s practicing certificate and/or Victoria Police\u2019s legal insurance.   \nIt should be noted that employees working from  home or working remotely should not be \nconcurrently caring for a person/child while performing their work hours.  \nThe following will be considered in a remote or home-based-work application: \n\u2022 the ability of the employee to complete their remote or HBW within their ordinary hours of \nwork \n\u2022 the effect (if any) on the employee\u2019s work unit \n\u2022 the ability to successfully delegate work to an employee who is working -from-home or \nremotely \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n29 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 whether an employee who is working-from-home or remotely can be properly supervised \nand their work properly assessed (if an employee has requested to work remotely from a \nlocation with a different time zone, the practicality of communication and supervision needs \nto be considered) \n\u2022 an employee\u2019s ability to work autonomously i.e. an employee who requires close \nsupervision or constant interaction with other staff may not be suitable for the independent \nenvironment of remote or HBW with minimal supervision \n\u2022 details provided by the employee in their OH&S Self-Assessment Checklist \u2013 refer to VPM, \n\u201cHuman resource management, Flexible work arrangements, Practitioner Guides and \nResources\u201d  \n\u2022 evidence that the employee will be able to work in a room or area secluded from other \nparts of the home \n\u2022 equipment and resources necessary for the employee to effectively  work-from-home or \nremotely. \n Additional factors for employees and managers \nAdditional factors for employees and managers to think about when considering applications \nfor a remote or HBW arrangement include: \n\u2022 appropriate security  measures that must be appli ed to Victoria Police equipment and \ninformation when it is in trans it to and from a remote or HBW location and being used, \nstored away or disposed of (refer to section 6.8 for more detailed information) \n\u2022 in accordance with VPMG Information and i nformation equipment disposal, any \nequipment (including personally owned equipment) that has been used to collect or store \nofficial information must be cleansed of all data or destroyed when:  \n\u2212 it has reached the end of its useful life  \n\u2212 prior to being sold or given to a third party. \n\u2022 for police members: \n\u2212 approved working-from-home arrangements should be in a proposed shift pattern as \nagreed between the employee and work unit manager, these should reflect the usual \nworking pattern of the employee and work unit. \n\u2022 for VPS employees: \n\u2212 if a VPS employee seeks to work outside their span of normal working hours, they will \nneed to negotiate an IFA with their management and formalised through consultation \nwith Workplace Relations. \n\u2022 if an application to work-from-home or work remotely is approved and signed off by the \nrelevant delegate, a copy of the signed application is to be provided to the employee as a \nrecord of the arrangement and agreed hours and days of the remote or HBW \n\u2022 employees must be contactable and available for communi cation with their workplace \nduring the period in which remote or HBW is carried out. \nAdditional factors for a remote work arrangement \n\u2022 Victoria Police issued IT equipment being transported to other locations must be conveyed \nby a Victoria Police employee or secure courier service for security purposes. Where a secure \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n30 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \ncourier service is utilised, this will incur additional costs. Employees working interstate or \noverseas may pose signific ant risk to Victoria Police information if equipment is not \ntransported in line with protocols.  \n\u2022 New devices require initialisation through a secure connection from a Victoria Police \nlocation, this may not be achievable via remote laptop access in the first instance.  \n\u2022 The practicality of working hours may need to be thoroughly dis cussed and/or agreed \nbetween local management and the employee. This should consider the business needs of \nthe unit, contact hours required, and occupational health and safety risks. This is particularly \nimportant if the employee wishes to work from a location in a different time zone.  \n\u2022 Advice should be sought from Workplace Relations when considering a request for a \nremote work arrangement. \n6.7 Conditions \nCosts associated with a home-based-work location \n\u2022 Except for Victoria Police issued I T equipment, the emplo yee is responsible for all costs \nassociated with establishing and maintaining their home-based-work location.  These costs \ninclude home and contents insurance, and modifications to comply with security and OH&S \nrequirements. \n\u2022 Any implications related to tax deductibility for a home-based-work location is a matter for \nemployees to pursue with the Australian Taxation Office. It is important for employees to \nkeep records  of business and personal expenses and to seek accountancy advice \nconcerning any taxation requirements. \nCosts associated with a remote work location \n\u2022 Victoria Police may be responsible for the cost incurred for any directed travel from the \nemployee\u2019s designated remote work location (if there is a requirement for \nintrastate/interstate travel as part of the employee\u2019s position description), including excess \ntravel, accommodation and meal expenses.  \n\u2022 As part of the remote working arrangement, the local area may nominate a number of trips \nper month/year for the employee to return to their usual place of work in Victoria, Victoria \nPolice may also be responsible for the costs associated with these trips.  \nTermination of a remote or home-based-work arrangement \n\u2022 A remote or HBW arrangement may, at any time, be altered or terminated at the request of \neither the employee or employer, after discussion and agreement between the parties. Any \nalteration or termination of a remote or HBW arrangement must be in writing.  \n\u2022 Termination of a remote work arrangement may incur relocation costs. \n\u2022 Employees can access dispute resolution as per the relevant clauses of the applicable \nenterprise agreement or as outlined under clause 14 of the Sworn Agreement or clause 10 \nof the VPS Agreement if an agreement to work remotely or from home is refused or \nterminated. \n \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n \n31 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 Victoria Police\u2019 s decision to approve a  remote o r HBW arrangement request may be \nrevoked with the provision of four weeks\u2019 written notice. Reasons for which a decision may \nbe revoked include but are not limited to: \n\u2212 changes to the employee\u2019s duties, responsibilities or home-based-work location such \nthat it is no longer possible for them to work-from-home or work remotely \n\u2212 it becomes clear that the employee is not undertaking their required duties on the \ndays/or shifts they work-from-home and reasonable measures have been taken to \nresolve the performance issues \n\u2212 the employee does not comply with security or OH&S requirements \n\u2212 if the employee obtains a new position within the organisation, the home-based-work \narrangement will cease to exist, and if required, a new one negotiated with the new \nwork area. \n\u2022 Victoria Police\u2019s decision to approve a remote or HBW  arrangement request may be \nrevoked immediately at the direction of the Assistant Commissioner, Professional Standards \nCommand or the Agency Security Adviso r.

This means the organisation and its employees are obliged to take steps \nto prevent discriminatory practices or behaviours, not just respond to issues or complaints of \ndiscrimination when they occur. \nTo meet this requirement:  \n\u2022 As an employer, Victoria Police main tains a workplace that values the diversity and \nindividuality of its employees and encourages a workplace that is inclusive, respectful and \nfair;  \n\u2022 As an employer, Victoria Police must exercise positive duty to accommodate reasonable \nworkplace adjustments s o that a person with disability can have equality of access, \nemployment and advancement opportunities (as per VPM Reasonable workplace \nadjustment); \n\u2022 All Victoria Police employees and others covered by this policy are expected to exercise \ntheir positive duty  by preventing discriminatory practices and encourage behaviours that \ntreat others with dignity, courtesy and respect; and  \n\u2022 Policy owners must exercise positive duty by taking the necessary steps to eliminate barriers \nto equal opportunity when reviewing or developing systems, policy, training, infrastructure \nand equipment in their portfolio.  \nPositive duty refers to the duty of employers under Part 3 of the Equal Opportunity Act to take positive \naction to eliminate discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation. \n \nPolicy \nVictoria Police is committed  to providing flexible work options to assist employees to achieve an \nappropriate work/life balance, noting the dynamic nature of the policing environment and \nacknowledging not all types of flexibility will work for every role . As such Victoria Police provides its \nemployees with flexibility in working arrangements, where it can reasonably be accommodated, taking \ninto account the employee\u2019s family and carer responsibilities, disability, religion and culture. This applies \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n  \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nto all LGBTIQ employees and family structures such as same sex coupled parents, single parents etc. \nWork unit managers are expected to consider and apply this policy when managing their workplaces. \nWorkplace flexibility represe nts cooperation and genuine commitment between employer and \nemployee for mutual benefit. Whilst not all forms of flexibility will be suitable for all roles at particular \ntimes or under particular circumstances  due to the nature of Victoria Police\u2019s busines s and having to \nmatch resourcing to demands , genuine consideration must be given to  the employee\u2019s needs  and \ncircumstances, alongside service delivery, rostering requirements, and corporate responsibility. This may \nrequire additional discussion with the employee to reach agreement on an alternative proposal that \naccommodates the employee\u2019s circumstances and still meets the needs of the local unit. Victoria Police \nnotes that flexible work practices  also assist in attraction and retention and contribute to increased \nproductivity and efficiency of employees. \nIn accordance with legislation and the principles of merit and equity, Victoria Police applies a standard \nof \u2018equitable\u2019, rather than a standard of the \u2018same\u2019. \n \n1.

These employees may still be able to access flexible working arrangements where \ntheir circumstances fall within relevant anti-discrimination legislation , either when \ncommencing employment with Victoria Police or within the first 12 months of their service. \n\u2022 Police members who are subject to time in position requirements are not prevented from \nseeking a flexible work arrangement under this policy or clause 14 of their agreement. \n\u2022 A request for a flexible working arrangement (FWA) or individual flexibility arrangement \n(IFA) must be considered in accordance with the: \n\u2212 relevant enterprise agreements  \n\u2212 Equal Opportunity Act  \n\u2212 Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (where relevant) \n\u2212 Age Discrimination Act 2004 (where relevant) \n\u2212 Fair Work Act 2009  \n\u2212 Checklist  \n\u2212 relevant sections of this policy. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \n \n  \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 The Fair Work Act  and enterprise agreements provide that employees have the right to \nrequest a FWA  (including part -time and change in work location) in the following  \ncircumstances, namely where the employee:  \n\u2212 has responsibility as parent or carer of a child who is of school age or younger \n\u2212 is a carer within the meaning of the Carer Recognition Act 2010 \n\u2212 has a disability \n\u2212 is 55 years of age or older \n\u2212 is experiencing family or domestic violence  \n\u2212 provides personal care, support or assistance to a member of the employee's \nimmediate family, or a member of the employee's household, who requires care, \nsupport or assistance because they are experiencing family or domestic violence. \n\u2022 The VPS Agreement provides all VPS employees a right to enter into an IFA in order to meet \nthe genuine needs of the employee and employer. An IFA: \n\u2212 does not require the employee to have a protected attribute (for example, a disability, \nparent/ carer responsibility as with an FWA); \n\u2212 must be genuinely agreed to between the employee and employer;  \n\u2212 varies the effect of clause 38 (Hours of Work) or Clause 39 (Shift Work). \n\u2022 The Equal Opportunity Act (s19) provides a right to parents and carers to have their caring \nresponsibilities accommodated where reasonable, and provides that the employer must not \nunreasonably refuse to accommodate those responsibilities.   \n\u2022 The Checklist exists as an aid for managers when considering applicable requests for a \nflexible arrangement. \n\u2022 Managers must consider applications carefully  and with an attitude of \u2018how can we make \nthis work\u2019 . Managers must  meet and discuss an application with the employee and \ngenuinely try to reach agreement on a change in working arrangements that will reasonably \naccommodate the employee\u2019s circumstances having regard to: \n\u2212 the needs of the employee arising from their circumstances \n\u2212 the consequences for the employee if changes in working arrangements are not made \n\u2212 any alternative flexibility arrangements that may meet the circumstances of the \nemployee that require flexibility \n\u2212 any reasonable business grounds for refusing the request. \n\u2022 Where an agreement is reach ed between the employer and employee on a change in \nworking arrangements that differs from that initially requested by the employee, the \nemployer must provide the employee with a written response to their request setting out \nthe agreed change(s) in working arrangements.   \n\u2022 An employee's request for a flexible arrangement may only be refused on reasonable \nbusiness grounds. Refer to the Checklist for assistance in consideration of business grounds. \nReasonable business grounds include, but are not limited to: \n\u2212 the new working arrangement requested by the employee would result in an \nunreasonable impact on the budget of the unit \n\u2212 there is no capacity to change the working arrangements of other employees to \naccommodate the new working arrangements requested by the employee \n\u2212 it would not be feasible to change the working arrangements of other employees, or \nrecruit new employees, to accommodate the new working arrangements requested by \nthe employee \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \n \n  \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2212 the new working arrangements requested by the employee would be likely to result in \na significant loss in efficiency or productivity \n\u2212 the new working arrangements requested by the employee would be likely to have a \nsignificant negative impact on customer service. \n\u2022 Impact on service delivery, resources, and operational requirement s will be key \nconsiderations in all applications , along with impact on the employee.  Local impact and \norganisational impact may also be considered.  \n\u2022 Where an application cannot be accommodated on  reasonable business grounds, \nmanagement should consider any other means by which the employee can be assisted, \nincluding temporary transfer, performing temporary duties in close proximity to the \nrequested work location, alternative flexible rostering arrangements, shift variations as \ndeemed appropriate, or other welfare support. \n\u2022 Police members only \u2013  prior to approving  an application from a probationary officer or \nRecruit, consideration must be given to the above points and also to the impact on the \nemployee\u2019s training program, to ensure that all mandatory training requirements are able \nto be completed in the requisite timeframes.  \n\u2022 Each application must be assessed on its merits and in light of the individual circumstances \nof the employee. \n1.6 Procedures and timeframes \n\u2022 Employees should submit their requests for flexible work arrangements in writing (using the \nrelevant form as specified in the policy section or the Flexible Arrangements Application \nForm, or where that is not possible, by email or general report VP form 47) to their local \nmanager as far in advance of the desired implementation of the requested change as \npossible to allow due consideration of the request. \n\u2022 Applications must include (see Checklist for further guidance): \n\u2212 details of the circumstances applicable to the request \n\u2212 an outline of the timeframe the circumstances will likely apply (where known) \n\u2212 supporting information or documentation to support the circumstances such as \nmedical reports, details of carer or parental responsibilities, and any other information \nthat will assist management consideration of the application, where necessary. \n\u2022 A written response to the request (including the particulars of the reasonable business \ngrounds if refusing an application) must be provided by their local  management or the \nrelevant Delegate to the employee. \n\u2022 Where the request is a FWA, a written response must be provided within 21 calendar days \nof the manager receivin g their written application. This applies regardless of how an \nemployee submits their application, for example if an employee emails their manager with \ntheir request and then submits the application form at a later date to formalise the request, \nthe 21 day time period starts from the date of the email. \n\u2022 In consideration of the requirement to respond in writing within  21 calendar days, local \nmanagement must: \n\u2212 provide to the Delegate in a timely manner, copies of the application supporting \nevidence, and local management's assessment of the application \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n9 \n \n \n \n  \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2212 if appropriate, convene a meeting with the Delegate for the purpose of considering \nthe application, and/or employee to obtain further information in relation to the \napplication or to discuss the request, and/or alternative flexibility arrangements.  \n1.7 Duration of flexible working arrangement \nA request for a change in working arrangements will not be considered a permanent change in \nworking arrangements. A f lexible arrangement may be subject to review at any  time e.g. if \noperational requirements or the employee\u2019s circumstances change . Such a review must  be \nconducted at least every 12 months, where practical to ensure the arrangement still meets the \nneeds of the employee and employer. Any review should be documented, and a copy retained \non the employee's file. \n1.8 Variations \n\u2022 An employee and their manager may seek to vary a flexible working arrangement as \nrequired.  Variations are subject to policy and legislative requirements.   \n\u2022 Variations to a flexible working arrangement must be done in consultation with the aim of \nmutual agreement with the employee or employees where two employees mutually rely on \na flexible working arrangement.  \n\u2022 Any variation to an employee\u2019s working arrangements should be documented and signed \nby both parties, and copies retained on the employee's file.  \n\u2022 For more details about documenting arrangements, refer to each of the relevant sections \nfor specific workplace flexibility arrangements or to specific policies (e.g. VPM Leave). \n1.9 Termination  \n\u2022 An employee or the delegate may terminate an IFA by: \n\u2212 giving no more than 28 days written notice to the other party in the arrangement; or \n\u2212 the delegate and employee agree in writing \u2013 at any time. \n\u2022 An employee or the delegate may terminate a FWA by: \n\u2212 providing written notice to the employee that the FWA cannot be continued based on \nreasonable business grounds; or \n\u2212 where the period of the FWA comes to an end. \n1.10 Recording of hours of work \nAll employees must complete, maintain and submit records of attendance in accordance with \nthe requirements outlined in the applicable enterprise agreement. \n1.11 Flexible working arrangements for employees returning from parental leave \n\u2022 To assist an employee in reconciling work and parental responsibilities, police members will \nbe entitled to choose the number of days they will work, which days of the week they will \nwork and which shifts they will work (in line with typically rostered shifts at their workplace) \nfor the first six weeks after they return to work.   \n\u2022 If a request for flexible working arrangement is granted (including by a full-time employee \nwho has taken parental leave to return to work on a part-time basis), this does not constitute \na permanent change to the employee\u2019s position with Victoria Police. \n\u2022 If a full- time employee who has returned from parental leave works on a part -time basis \npursuant to a flexible working arrangement, they are entitled to return to their substantive \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nfull-time position once the flexible working arrangement ends, and the procedure set out \nin this policy will not apply.  \n1.12 Recording of decisions \nOnce a decision has been made in respect of a request for flexible working arrangements, a \ncopy of the application form, decision and reasons for it must be retained on the employee's \nfile. \nAny flexible arrangement must: \n\u2022 be in writing on the Flexible Arrangement Application Form \n\u2022 include the name of the employee and employer, and be signed by both \n\u2022 include details of: \n\u2212 the day on which the arrangement commences; \n\u2212 the date on which the arrangement finishes. \nand for an IFA: \n\u2212 the terms of employment (clauses of the relevant enterprise agreement) that will be \nvaried by the arrangement  \n\u2212 how the arrangement will vary the terms  \n\u2212 how the employee will be better off overall in relation to the terms and conditions of \ntheir employment as a result of the arrangement \n\u2212 how the IFA can be terminated. \nA copy of any IFA must be provided to the employee within 14 days after it is agreed to. \n1.13 Expression of interest transfer (police members only) \nWhere an employee has an existing flexible work arrangement and is successful in gaining a \ntransfer via the expression of interest process, their flexible work arrangement will transfer to \nand continue at the new w ork location unless it will result in significant negative impact on \nservice delivery, productivity or efficiency.  \n1.14 Dispute resolution \n\u2022 Where an application for a FWA (made under section 65 of the Fair Work Act or clause 10 \nof the VPS Agreement or clause 14  of the Sworn Agreement) has been refused, attempts \nshould be made to resolve the dispute at the workplace level. \n\u2022 An employee may choose to be represented at any stage by a representative, including \nunion representative.  \n\u2022 If a dispute is not settled with local resolution, or it is deemed inappropriate for the dispute \nto be discussed at the workplace level, employees (or their representatives) also have the \noption to use dispute resolution procedures outlined in the relevant enterprise agreement. \nThis includes the option of applying to the Fair Work Commission to have the dispute dealt \nwith by conciliation. \n\u2022 Alternatively, an employee may request a review of actions within 28 calendar days of \nnotification of the workplace flexibility outcome in accordance with VPM Review of actions \n(grievance).  If an employee elects to refer a matter to the Fair Work Commission then the \nmatter will be deemed out of scope of VPM Review of actions (grievance). \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n11 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n2. Pregnancy in the workplace \n2.1 Overview \n\u2022 Victoria Police is committed to providing and maintaining a working environment for all \npregnant employees that is safe and without risks to health.  \n\u2022 So far as is reasonably practica l, pregnant employees will be provided with the option to \nundertake alternative duties where there is risk to the pregnant employee, their pregnancy, \ncolleagues and/or members of the public if they continue their usual role.    \n\u2022 Denying or limiting access to promotion, secondment, temporary duties, transfers or \ntraining on the basis of pregnancy, or potential pregnancy is discrimination and/or adverse \naction and employees must not be denied or limited access to these opportunities or to \nany other benefits connected with their employment.  \n2.2 Definitions \nRegistered Medical Practitione r: means a registered Doctor of Medicine and includes \nspecialists such as an Obstetrician.  \n2.3 Notification and risk assessment \nOnce pregnant, some aspects of an employee\u2019s role may pose risks to the employee and their \npregnancy. For this reason, pregnant employees are encouraged to notify their manager of their \npregnancy as soon as practicable, taking into consideration that some roles will pose higher \nhealth and safety risks to the employee and their pregnancy than others . An employee must \nprovide at least 10 weeks written notice of the intention to take parental leave , including the \nproposed start and end dates and the expected due date. Notification should include a \nconfinement certificate from a Registered Medical Practitioner confirming the pregnan cy and \nexpected due date.   \nThe manager is to ensure that the notification of pregnancy is treated confidentially and is \nrespectful of the pregnant employee.   \nEarly notification will ensure that a risk assessment can be conducted to determine appropriate \nduties during the pregnancy to avoid placing the pregnant employee or their pregnancy at risk.  \nAn occupational  health and safety risk assessment of the employee\u2019s duties should  be \nconducted by the manager, in consultation with the employee, and will be based on advice from \nthe employee\u2019s Registered Medical Practitioner. This will enable an informed decision to be \nmade based on the Registered Medical Practitioner\u2019s advice regarding appropri ate duties \nduring the pregnancy  taking into consideration identified risks in the work environment . The \nemployee must provide the employer with a certificate from their Registered Medical \nPractitioner using the \u2018 Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019  \u2013 refer to \nVPM, \u201cHuman resource management , Flexible work arrangements, Practitioner Guides and \nResources\u201d. \nAny risk assessment must take into account the following:    \n\u2022 any potential risks to the health and safety of the pregnant employee and their pregnancy  \n\u2022 an OHS risk assessment of the work environment \n\u2022 the pregnant employee\u2019s preferences and circumstances including level of expertise \n\u2022 Operational Safety Tactics and Training (OSTT) requirements for operational duties \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n12 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 medical advice.   \nIt is the employee\u2019s responsibility to provide their Registered Medical Practitioner with a copy \nof the \u2018Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019 for them to complete.  \nIn consultation with their manager, an employee will be required to complete the \u2018Workplace \nSupport Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in Touch, and Return to Work from Parental Leave\u2019. The plan is \nintended to support employees and their managers through the process. \nFor further guidance on the workplace risk assessment and the \u2018Medical Information Pack and \nCertification Form\u2019 also refer to the \u2018Pregnancy in the Workplace and Return to Work after \nParental Leave Guide\u2019, this can be found on VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Flexible work \narrangements, Practitioner Guides and Resources\u201d. \n2.4 Duties during pregnancy \n\u2022 Appropriate duties that have been determined, and as agreed between the manager and \nthe employee, must be recorded on the \u2018Workplace Support Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in \nTouch, and Return to Work from Parental Leave\u2019.  \n\u2022 If the work duties that have been agreed to, for the period of pregnancy, differ from the \nemployee\u2019s substantive position, the employee will continue to own and occupy their \nsubstantive position whilst performing the temporary duties. The employee will continue to \nreceive remuneration at their substantive rank/classification.  \n\u2022 Duties undertaken by a pregnant employee must be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure \nthat they do not expose the employee to unnecessary risk. This review might inform further \nchanges to the duties which can be safely performed. The employee must notify their  \nregistered medical practitioner and their manager of any developments in the pregnancy \nthat may present as a health risk so that appropriate adjustments to duties can be made.   \n\u2022 Refer to section 2.5 for information on transfer to a safe job. \nHigher duties \n\u2022 Where a pregnant employee is undertaking a higher duties assignment but, due to the \npregnancy cannot perform all of the duties of that assignment, and alternative duties or \nreasonable adjustments to work responsibilities at the higher rank/classification cannot be \naccommodated, the employee will no longer be eligible for the full higher duties allowance \nand will revert to their substantive position.  \n\u2022 For VPS employees, if the pregnant employee undertakes part of the duties of a higher \nclassified position, t he level of the allowance shall be in proportion to the extent of the \nhigher duties being performed (refer to VPM Remuneration for more information on \nhigher duties). \n\u2022 When considering the above, it should be remembered that it is unlawful to discriminate \nbased on pregnancy. \nShift work \nFollowing the risk assessment the employee may be exempt from shift work or night shift where, \non the basis of the risk assessment (and/or advice from a Registered Medical Practitioner) it is \ndetermined that there are additional risks to the employee\u2019s safety during those shifts or where \na medical certificate accompanies the request.  \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n13 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nOperational Safety and Tactics Training (OSTT)/Operational and Promotional Training \n\u2022 A decision regarding the completion of OSTT or other operational and promotional training \nduring pregnancy is one that the employee should only make following consideration of \nthe information provided in the \u2018Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019, and must \nbe consistent with advice provided by their  medical practitioner. Pregnant employees \nwanting to undertake OSTT or other operational and promotion training must discuss the \nrisks associated with the training with their medical practitioner and o btain medical \nclearance to do so.   \n\u2022 For the avoidance of doubt, pregnant employees can be selected for promotions with a \nphysical component. This component may be completed upon the selectee\u2019s return to \noperational duties from parental leave. \n2.5 Entitlements during pregnancy \nDress for police members \n\u2022 Where the member\u2019s uniform can no longer be worn comfortably due to their pregnancy, \nthe member will be permitted to wear plain (professional) clothes.  \n\u2022 Pregnant members performing duties in plain clot hes are entitled to receive a temporary \ncivilian clothing allowance. \nTransfer to a safe job  \n\u2022 Where an employee is pregnant and, in the opinion of a Registered Medical Practitioner, is \nfit for work, but it is inadvisable for them to continue at their present work because of illness \nor risks arising out of their pregnancy or hazards connected with the work assigned to the \nemployee, the employee will be transferred, if reasonably practicable, to an appropriate safe \njob for the risk period.    \n\u2022 The safe job may involve working from a different location or may mean modifying the \nemployee's existing role to remove any identified risks. This will depend on the result of the \nrisk assessment and opinion of the medical practitioner. \n\u2022 The safe job must involve meaningful  duties and be commensurate with the employee\u2019s \nskills, training and experience. This may include undertaking work from another work unit \nor the employee working from an alternative work location for a specific period or the \nduration of the pregnancy.  \n\u2022 The safe job will not alter the employee\u2019s terms and conditions of employment.

Lactation breaks \n3.1 Principles \nVictoria Police is committed to fostering a supportive work environment for employees who \nchoose to breastfeed by: \n\u2022 providing appropriate workplace facilities for employees who choose to express breast milk \nor breastfeed their child \n\u2022 providing paid lactation breaks during work hours \n\u2022 ensuring all employees\u2019 awareness of breastfeeding policies and facilities \n\u2022 seeking to eliminate any unlawful direct and/or indirect discrimination on the grounds of \nbreastfeeding. \nEmployees who choose to breastfeed should be supported in that choice and treated with \ndignity and respect in the workplace. \n3.2 Definitions \nBreastfeeding: for the pu rpose of this policy, this includes the physiological process of milk \nbeing produced to breastfeed or express breast milk for an infant or young child.  \nCaregiver: a caregiver is a person who assumes responsibility for bringing an infant or young \nchild onto Victoria Police premises with the intent of delivering the infant or young child to an \nemployee for the purpose of breastfeeding. \nLactation breaks: paid breaks taken by an  employee in consultation with their employer for \nthe sole purpose of enabling an e mployee to express breast milk or breastfeed an infant or \nyoung child off site or at the workplace. \nChild: generally refers to a child up to school age ; however consideration should be given to \nemployee\u2019s individual circumstances and needs for breastfeeding a child. \n3.3 Breastfeeding facilities \n\u2022 Workplace facilities should be provided, where practical, for employees who choose to \nexpress breast milk or breastfeed their child during work hours. \n\u2022 Facilities should be accessible for all, in terms of space, location and security access.  \n\u2022 The minimum requirements for an appropriate workplace facility include, as far as  \npracticable: \n\u2212 a private, clean and hygienic space/room which is suitably signed and lockable \n\u2212 appropriate seating, a table or bench to support breastfeeding (and breastfeeding \nequipment) \n\u2212 suitable storage area for any equipment and/or electric breastfeeding equipment \n\u2212 a power point for breast pumps and other equipment \n\u2212 access in the workplace, to a refrigerator/freezer for storing milk and a microwave \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n15 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2212 access to a sink near the private space/room with hot water for washing hands and \nequipment \n\u2212 nappy change table                       \n\u2212 an appropriate receptacle for rubbish and nappy disposal.   \n\u2022 It is not appropriate for employees to breastfeed or express breast milk in toilet facilities, \nnor is it an appropriate location for equipment to be cleaned. Sinks and refrigeration located \nin a s taffroom or kitchen facility should be used. Refer to the Australian Breastfeeding \nAssociation website for guidance on storage of expressed milk, if required.   \n\u2022 Generally, workplace facilities should be used, however consideration should be given to \nallowing the employee to go home, to a caregiver\u2019s home or accessing a childcare centre if \nrequested.  Requests should be assessed on a case by case basis. \n3.4 Lactation breaks \nThe frequency, duration and timing of lactation breaks: \n\u2022 should be determined through consultation between the employee and their manager to \nallow the flexibility needed to breastfeed or express milk \n\u2022 will vary between individuals and may be influenced by factors including the child\u2019s age, \nfeeding habits, the location of the breastfeeding room and any special requirements  \n\u2022 will likely reduce in frequency and increase in flexibility for scheduling around operational \nneeds over time. Police employees are entitled to up to one hour lactation break(s) per \neight hour shift, with these brea ks being in addition to rest periods and meal breaks. The \none hour lactation break for each shift may be utilised through multiple short breaks if the \nemployee prefers.  VPS employees are entitled to reasonable time during working hours. \nThe employee\u2019s individual circumstances and needs should be taken into consideration \n\u2022 are to be documented in a \u2018Lactation Breaks Plan\u2019 , which should be reviewed on a regular \nbasis \u2013 refer to VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Flexible work arrangements , \nPractitioner Guides and Resources\u201d.  A copy of the agreement should be retained by each \nparty \n\u2022 should be timed where possible to consider reasonable business and organisational needs \nwith a focus on supporting employee health, while minimising disruption to the workplace \nand service delivery. If, in emergency situations, there is a need to delay the taking of a \nlactation break, efforts should be made to ensure that the employee is able to take the \nbreak as soon as practicable in order to mitigate any risks to the employee\u2019s health or milk \nsupply or the child\u2019s health \n\u2022 the employee may return home or attend another location during the break as agreed with \ntheir manager \n\u2022 where the child or infant is breas tfed offsite, the lactation break is inclusive of the time \nneeded to travel directly to and from the agreed location. Where this cannot be achieved \nwithin the break, alternate arrangements may be negotiated.   \n3.5 Responsibilities \nEmployees  \n\u2022 An employee intending to continue breastfeeding when returning to work should discuss \ntheir needs with their immediate manager prior to returning to work.   \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n16 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 The employee is responsible for:  \n\u2212 providing their own expressing and sterilising equipment and storage containers \n\u2212 ensuring that stored breast milk is properly secured, labelled and safely stored in a \nsealed receptacle \n\u2212 providing appropriate nappy change items should the infant or child be delivered to \nthe workplace \n\u2212 ensuring hygiene is maintained at all times, such as washing hands, hygienic disposal \nof nappies and rubbish, and leaving the workplace facility clean and tidy. \n\u2022 In addition, the employee is responsible for ensuring the caregiver: \n\u2212 is aware their access to the workplace is restricted to delivering the infant or young \nchild to the employee for the purpose of breastfeeding \n\u2212 vacates the workplace with the infant(s) and/or child at the completion of each \nbreastfeeding break \n\u2212 supervises the infant(s) and/or child at all times in the workplace. \nManagers  \n\u2022 The manager is responsible for:  \n\u2212 discussions occurring before an employee returns to work \n\u2212 ensuring the employee is not subjected to inappropriate behaviour or attitudes by \nother employees \n\u2212 ensuring appropriate facilities are available for lactation breaks \n\u2212 ensuring that decisions made regarding requests for lactation breaks are impartial, \ntransparent and capable of review \n\u2212 reviewing arrangements with the employee on a regular basis \n\u2212 where emergency situations result in a delay to scheduled lactation breaks, ensuring \nthat the employee can take their break as soon as possible to mitigate any health and \nsafety risks. \n\u2022 Where having considered all options, a manager anticipates that it will not be possible to \naccommodate lactation breaks, advice must be sought from Workplace Relations. \n \n4.

Ordinary hours of work for each rostered shift must be continuous. \n\u2022 Hours of work for part-time members can be structured different ways including:  \n\u2212 set start and finishing times on each day; and/or \n\u2212 a number of hours and days over a specified period. \n\u2022 Part-time arrangements should be in writing and provide for the set days or set hours of \nwork (or both) or an agreed number of hours and days to be worked flexibly. This means \nthat a process can be included in a part -time arrangement, which sets out parameters for \nany alteration to the pattern of the hours on a fortnightly basis . This is  with a view to \nmeeting the  employee\u2019s work/life balance while  taking into account the operational \nrequirements of the employer. Any such provision must be recorded in a written application \nfor a flexible work arrangement, or application to vary an existing flexible work \narrangement.  \n\u2022 The pattern of hours of a part -time member may vary from the standard roster at a work \narea only with the agreement of the employer.  \n\u2022 Where possible, shift lengths should be the same as the shift lengths at the station to which \nthe member is attached. However, a shorter or longer shift length can be agreed if it suits \nthe needs of the member and the workplace, the minimum shift duration is four hours.  \nVPS employees \n\u2022 Hours of work must include an agreed number of hours and days over a specified period. \n\u2022 Unless the employee is a shift worker, part-time hours of work must be rostered within the \nordinary span of hours of 7am to 7pm , Monday to Friday . An exception to this is if an \nemployee and their employer enter into an individual flexibility arrangement to meet the \ngenuine needs of both parties.

Childcare entitlements and \nexpenses apply as per the applicable enterprise agreement for VPS employees and police \nmembers. \nPolice members \n\u2022 Where the member\u2019s rostered shift is changed without the member\u2019s consent and 72 hours \nor less notice is given, the change of shift penalty will apply.  \n\u2022 Change of shift penalty is an additional amount of 25% of an employee\u2019s base hourly rate \nof pay for the duration of the changed shift. This penalty will not apply during a period \nwhere overtime is payable. \n\u2022 Part-time police members should not normally be required to be available for resumption \nof duty unless included in the \u2018Application for a Part-time Arrangement/Application to Vary \nExisting Part-time Arrangement\u2019 form.

A part -time \nworking pattern agreement for the assignment position should be documented and signed \nby both parties.   \nSurplus employees \nIf a part-time position is abolished, the employee is declared surplus and is placed under the \nprovisions of 306 -11 Redeployment (VPS) or VPM Mobility and redeployment ( police \nmembers). Where a part -time position is not available, surplus staff will be matched to \nappropriate full-time position in consultation with the employee. The employee may apply for \nthe position, to which they are matched, to be converted to part-time in accordance with section \n4.5 above.   \nSuperannuation \nPart-time employment has implications for superannuation.

Employees who own/occupy two part-time positions must ensure \nthat the hours for each position are compatible. The member must communicate with each \nauthorised delegate separately concerning any changes that may impact on either position. \nThis includes the impact of attendance at training.    \n\u2022 When making decisions in relation to one of the positions t he employee occupies, the \nauthorised delegate must consult with the authorised delegate of the other position \noccupied by the employee.  \n\u2022 Examples of the types of decisions that authorised delegates should consult over are:  \n\u2212 a direction to work overtime (to ensure that hours of both positions are taken into \nconsideration)  \n\u2212 approval of assignment or higher duties \n\u2212 the requirement to undertake compulsory training.     \nTime in position \u2013 police members \nWhen a police member occupies two part -time positions, time in position dates are the dates \nfor each individual position.  \nRate of pay \nThe employee shall receive salaries, entitlements and allowances, as provided by the relevant \nenterprise agreement, on  a pro-rata basis for the total number of hours worked in both \npositions.  \nPromotion or reversion \u2013 police members \nWhen the member\u2019s rank changes (promotion or reversion) the member will be unattached \nfrom all positions at the previous rank.  \nWorkCover  \nWorkCover responsibilities are to be managed by the workplace in which the injury occurred. If \nit is not known when or where the injury occurred (e.g.: injury occurring over a period of time), \nthen the claim should be managed by the workplace where the employee was located when \nthe claim was lodged.  \nRelinquishing a position  \nThe employee may vacate one of the owned positions at any time in order to revert to owning \nonly one part-time position. Where this occurs for police members, the member must not apply \nfor an additional part-time position which involves the same hours as the relinquished position \nuntil the balance of the time in position requirements of the relinquished position have been \nmet.   \n \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n23 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n4.8 Residual hours  \nManagement may consider using residual part -time hours to create and advertise additional \npart-time positions within their Police Service Area, Division, Region, Command or Department \nin order to fulfil the requirements of part of a role or fraction of unit. \nHowever, managers need to be mindful that surplus part-time hours (e.g. arising from requests \nby employees who have been  on parental leave  to return to work on a part -time basis) are \nbeing managed appropriately . These hours must not  be used to create new permanent \npositions that would prevent an employee on flexible arrangements from returning to full-time \nhours.  \nThe reason for this is t o assist an employee in reconciling work and parental responsibilities, \nemployees have the right to request to return to work at a reduced time-fraction until the child, \nor the youngest child, reaches school age, after which the employee will resume their \nsubstantive time-fraction or make application to work part-time as a flexible work arrangement, \nthis can be a permanent or temporary part-time arrangement.  \nDuring this time, the employee is on a temporary part-time agreement and the residual hours \n(FTE) either need to be quarantined or guaranteed to be restored on resumption of the \nemployee\u2019s pre parental leave hours (FTE).   \n \n5. Flexi-time (VPS employees only) \n5.1 Purpose \nVictoria Police is committed to providing flexibility in the workplace that takes into account the \nwork requirements of the organisation and the personal  and/or family circumstances of the \nemployee.  \n5.2 Flexi-time \n\u2022 An employee can work and accumulate flexi-time by agreement between the employer and \nemployee: \n\u2212 where the manager is satisfied that there is sufficient work to be performed; and  \n\u2212 where required, a sufficient level of supervision is available.  \n\u2022 Flexi-time must be negotiated within the normal span of hours between 7:00am and \n7:00pm, Monday to Friday. Unless the employee and their manager have entered into an \nIFA, any work performed outside of these hours is considered to be overtime. If entering \ninto an IFA, contact Workplace Relations. \n\u2022 Flexi-time is to be taken at a time mutually  agreed to between the employee and the \nmanager. \n\u2022 Flexi-time is not generally available to police members, shift workers, causal employees or \nVPSG-5 and above (and Forensic Officer equivalent), particularly those in management or \nsupervisory roles where business continuity would be adversely affected by flexi -time \narrangements. In exceptional circumstances however, an individual arrangement may be \nreached between the parties.  \n\u2022 Where it is determined that the accrual of flexi-time no longer meets the needs of the work \nunit, the manager is required to consult with the relevant employees and the relevant union \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n24 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nin accordance with the \u2018Implementation of change\u2019 provisions of the r elevant enterprise \nagreement. \n5.3 Flexi-credit \n\u2022 Unless exceptional circumstances exist, and approval is provided by the manager to carry a \ngreater accrual, the maximum amount of flexi-time credit allowed for a full-time employee \nis 15.2 hours, and for a part-time employee is the equivalent of two days of their part-time \nwork pattern.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has flexi-time credit in excess of the allowable limit, the manager may \ndirect the employee to take the excess hours, unless the flexi -time credit is to cover a \nChristmas Closedown period in accordance with section 5.6 of this policy.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has flexi-time credit excess and exceptional circumstances exist, a level \n2 delegate may approve for outstanding credits to be paid out to the employee at their \nordinary hourly rate of pay. \n\u2022 Where an employee does not use all of their flexi -credit prior to the cessation of their \nemployment with Victoria Police, they will be entitled to have any outstanding credits paid \nout to them at their ordinary hourly rate of pay.  \n5.4 Flexi-debit \n\u2022 In exceptional circumstances, an employee may take flexi-time without the necessary flexi-\ncredit being accrued. This can only occur with prior approval from the manager and must \nnot result in a full- time employee having a negative balance that exceeds - 7.6 (negative) \nhours for a full-time employee or that exceeds -1 (negative) day for a part-time employee. \n\u2022 If an employee has an excess flexi-debit and does not reduce the debit within a reasonable \nperiod as specified by the m anager, the employee must elect to utilise either recreation \nleave or leave without pay to recoup the debit.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has a flexi-debit on cessation of employment, money or leave owed by \nthe employee to the employer will be debited accordingly, at their ordinary hourly rate of \npay in accordance with the Financial Management Act 1994 (Vic), except where the cessation \nis due to death.   \n5.5 Taking flexi-time \n\u2022 Flexi-time must only be taken with prior approval from the employee\u2019s manager. In making \nany assessment as to when flexi-time can be taken, the manager will give full consideration \nto the employee\u2019s preferences; however, it may not always be possible for the employee to \ntake flexi-time on their nominated day due to the service delivery requirements of the work \nunit.  \n\u2022 Flexi-time should be taken as a full or half day based on the employee\u2019s ordinary hours of \nwork. At the discretion of the manager, approval may be given to an employee to take flexi-\nleave in hours.  \n5.6 Christmas closedown \n\u2022 Where a work unit manager intends to closedown part or all of the unit\u2019s operations for the \nthree working days from the first working day after Christmas Day to the end of the last \nworking day before New Year\u2019s Day (1 January) (closedown period), the work unit manager: \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n25 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2212 will notify relevant employees in writing of this intention no later than 1 October of \nthe year in which the closedown is to take place \n\u2212 will request relevant employees to utilise any accrued time-in-lieu, annual leave, \nsubstitute leave, flexi-time credits or additional hours accrued under a flexible working \narrangement \n\u2212 may require a minimum level of staffing to meet the operational requirements of the \nworkplace. \n\u2022 If there are insufficient expressions of interest from relevant employees to give effect to the \nclosedown period, the following process will be applied: \n\u2212 the work unit manager may direct an employee who has excessive recreation leave \n(more than eight weeks or two years accruals), to take recreation leave during the \nclosedown period \n\u2212 the work unit manager may then direct an employee with accrued time-in-lieu, flexi-\ntime credits or substitute leave to take that leave during the closedown period. \n\u2022 The work unit manager will provide at least four weeks\u2019 notice of any direction to take leave. \n \n6. Working-from-home and working remotely \n6.1 Overview \nVictoria Police aims to provide employment options to maximise workforce flexibility and \npromote a balance between optimal service delivery and employees\u2019 personal commitments.  \n\u2022 Victoria Police will be fair and transparent in considering requests by employ ees to work \nremotely or work-from-home. \n\u2022 Employees granted approval to work remotely or from home will continue to be provided \nwith equal opportunities in their employment. \n\u2022 Individual working-from-home or remote work arrangements may be permitted on an ad-\nhoc or short-term basis or on a more regular basis in line with other flexible arrangement \nrequests and will be reviewed regularly, having regard to both employees\u2019 personal \nresponsibilities and organisational needs. \n\u2022 Employees are not to undertake remote of home- based work unless they have obtained \napproval in accordance with this policy. \n\u2022 Where a State of Emergency or State of Disaster is declared, Victoria Police may issue other \nguidance which may supersede this policy in instances of differing information.   \n6.2 Definitions \nHome-based-work (HBW) location: the area designated by the employee within their home \nas the work location in which they will perform their home-based-work. This includes areas the \nemployee accesses in their home when taking breaks; such as the kitchen, bathroom, \npassageways and staircases. \nHome-based-work (HBW) arrangement: a flexible work arrangement that may be authorised \non a short-term basis to help accommodate employees\u2019 occasional and intermittent personal \ncommitments, and emergencies  or on a more regular basis to assist with an employee\u2019s \npersonal commitments and to help achieve an appropriate work/life balance.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n26 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nRemote work: refers to a location that the employee has requested to work from that is not \nthe employee\u2019s home and may be an interstate or overseas location.   \nRemote work arrangement: a flexible arrangement that may be author ised, on a short-term \nbasis only, where the employee will be working from another location, other than their home, \nthat may be an interstate or overseas location.  \n6.3 Eligibility \nAll employees other than recruits, probationary constables and VPS employees who are within \ntheir probationary period are eligible to apply to work-from-home or work remotely. Any \nexception to this will only be considered in exceptional circumstances or as part of a reasonable \nworkplace adjustment for a current or prospective employee with disability. \nApplications for a remote work arrangement from an interstate or overseas location will be \nconsidered on a case by case basis only and several factors will need to be considered, including \nthe role pe rformed and whether the role can be performed remotely or not. Relevant \nconsiderations are outlined throughout this section.  \n6.4 Information management & security \nPolicy adherence \n\u2022 All Authorised Users have a duty and responsibility to ensure that Victoria Police \ninformation is protected from harm, unauthorised or inappropriate disclosure. \n\u2022 If Victoria Police employees have approval for a remote or HBW arrangement, they must \nensure that they continue to adhere to Victoria Police policy. This includes maintaining the \nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of Victoria Police information. \n\u2022 To ensure the security of Victoria Police information, Authorised Users who are not Victoria \nPolice employees are not to undertake work at home or remotely. \nRisks \nWorking-from-home increases the security risks for Victoria Police information including (but \nnot limited to): \n\u2022 the potential for people without a \u2018need -to-know\u2019 or without an appropriate security \nclearance to gain access to (or read) official information or other official resources \n\u2022 loss of Victoria Police information in transit between the workplace and home \n\u2022 viruses or other malicious code being present or being introduced to IT equipment.  \nRefer to the Protective Security Practice Guide \u2013 810 - Working from home securely for further \nguidance. \nSecurity classified information \n\u2022 Information that has been assessed as PROTECTED or above is not to be worked on using \nhome-based or remote computer equipment, unless this is done on the Victoria Police \nnetwork through approved  secure two -factor authentication (such as Connect.Police \ntokens).  Refer t o VPM Information categorisation, collection and recording  for \ninformation on security classifications. \n\u2022 Hardcopy security classified information must be stored in a container suitable for the \nclassification of the material when not in use. Refer to Protective Security guide \u2013 G200 \u2013 \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n27 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nAssessment and handling of Victoria Police information. If a suitable securi ty container is \nnot available, then the information should not be taken home. \n\u2022 Any deviation from these requirements requires approval by the Department Head after \nseeking advice from the Information Security Manager and the Protective Security Manager, \nInformation Security, Security and Management Services Division. \n6.5 Occupational health & safety \n\u2022 Victoria Police will provide and maintain, so far as is reasonably practica l, workplaces and \nworking environments that are safe and without risks to health for all employees and \nindividuals using Victoria Police premises, facilities or equipment. This applies to an \napproved remote or HBW location. \n\u2022 Employees granted approval to work remotely or work-from-home must comply with their \nobligations under the Victorian Occupational Health and Safety Act  2004 and all relevant \nVictoria Police and WorkSafe occupational health and safety policies and procedures and \ntake corrective action to eliminate all potential hazards within their remote or HBW location.  \nAny hazards which cannot be immediately corrected must be reported.  \n\u2022 Employees will be required to comply with all reasonable and lawful directions by Victoria \nPolice from time to time, i ncluding directions regarding safe work methods which may \nrequire employees to rearrange or alter the remote or HBW location. \n\u2022 Employees must report all work related health and safety concerns or incidents that occur \nat their remote or HBW location to Victoria Police as soon as is reasonably practicable. \n\u2022 Where a WorkCover claim is accepted for an injury that occurred at a remote work location, \nconsideration must be given for a return to work arrangement and how that could be \npractically implemented where the employee is working remotely (interstate or overseas). \nThis may incur additional costs.  \n6.6 Applying \nApplication form \n\u2022 Employees applying for a remote work or HBW arrangement must complete a Flexible \nArrangements Application Form  (including an OH&S Self -Assessment Checklist for their \nhome-based-work location) and submit it to their line manager for consideration.  \nConsultation between the employee and manager should occur and any reasonable \nworkplace adjustments required should be discussed. Applications will be assessed on a \ncase by case basis and approval is at the discretion of management. \n\u2022 Accountability for considering remote or HBW applications remains with the approving \nlocation with final sign off required by Workplace Relations.  \n\u2022 Remote work arrangement applications must be approved by the Level 2 Delegate due to \nthe increased security risks and additional considerations associated with these requests. \nEmployee responsibilities \nIn all cases where an employee submits a request for remote or HBW, consultation must occur \nbetween the employee and their manager  as far in advance of the desired implementation of \nthe requested change as possible to allow due consideration of the request. It is the employee\u2019s \nresponsibility to ensure that:  \n\u2022 their manager receives their written request in a timely manner \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n28 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 they complete required forms and supply any supporting documentation for the application \nsuch as medical reports, details of carer or parental responsibilities, and any other \ninformation that will assist management consideration of the application \n\u2022 to provide their manager with sufficient information to reasonably consider their request \n\u2022 any changes in circumstances for the application are advised to their manager as soon as \npossible. \nManager responsibilities \nIn considering requests by employees to work-from-home or work remotely, the manager must \nconsider any relevant factors be fore providing the employee with a final decision. These may \ninclude: \n\u2022 compliance with all applicable legislation  (e.g. Equal Opportunity Act  and Disability \nDiscrimination Act and the Fair Work Act etc.)  \n\u2022 the nature of the responsibilities of the employee\u2019s position including supervision of other \nemployees, service response to other employees or the public, whether the employee \nrequires regular access to hard copy information and/or has access to sensitive or \nprotectively marked information \n\u2022 the nature of the employee\u2019s position and duties and whether any meetings, seminars, and \nconferences may be able to be facilitated remotely and/or online \n\u2022 whether the employee is fit for work , working-from-home is not a substitute for personal \nleave \n\u2022 whether the security risk of accessing Victoria Police information to enable an employee to \nwork remotely or work-from-home is too significant (refer to section 6.8 for more detailed \ninformation) \n\u2022 any security arrangements that an employee will need to comply with to enable a remote \nor home-based-work arrangement to be approved \n\u2022 whether the employee is in a position with specific liability considerations, for example legal \npositions. Remote work from an interstate or overseas location may have implications for \nthe individual\u2019s practicing certificate and/or Victoria Police\u2019s legal insurance.   \nIt should be noted that employees working from home or working remotely should not be \nconcurrently caring for a person/child while performing their work hours.  \nThe following will be considered in a remote or home-based-work application: \n\u2022 the ability of the employee to complete their remote or HBW within their ordinary hours of \nwork \n\u2022 the effect (if any) on the employee\u2019s work unit \n\u2022 the ability to successfully delegate work to an employee who is working -from-home or \nremotely \n\u2022 whether an employee who is working-from-home or remotely can be properly supervised \nand their work properly assessed (if an employee has requ ested to work remotely from a \nlocation with a different time zone, the practicality of communication and supervision needs \nto be considered) \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n29 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 an employee\u2019s ability to work autonomously i.e. an employee who requires close \nsupervision or constant interaction with other staff may not be suitable for the independent \nenvironment of remote or HBW with minimal supervision \n\u2022 details provided by the employee in their OH&S Self-Assessment Checklist \u2013 refer to VPM, \n\u201cHuman resource management, Flexible work arrangements, Practitioner Guides and \nResources\u201d  \n\u2022 evidence that the employee will be able to work in a room or area secluded from other \nparts of the home \n\u2022 equipment and resources necessary for the employee to effectively work -from-home or \nremotely. \n Additional factors for employees and managers \nAdditional factors for employees and managers to think about when considering applications \nfor a remote or HBW arrangement include: \n\u2022 appropriate security  measures that must be applied to Victoria Police equipment and \ninformation when it is in transit to and from a remote or HBW l ocation and being used, \nstored away or disposed of (refer to section 6.8 for more detailed information) \n\u2022 in accordance with VPM G Information and i nformation equipment disposal, any \nequipment (including personally owned equipment) that has been used to collect or store \nofficial information must be cleansed of all data or destroyed when:  \n\u2212 it has reached the end of its useful life  \n\u2212 prior to being sold or given to a third party. \n\u2022 for police members: \n\u2212 approved working-from-home arrangements should be in a proposed shift pattern as \nagreed between the employee and work unit manager, these should reflect the usual \nworking pattern of the employee and work unit. \n\u2022 for VPS employees: \n\u2212 if a VPS employee seeks to work outside their span of normal working hours, they will \nneed to negotiate an IFA with their management and formalised through consultation \nwith Workplace Relations. \n\u2022 if an application to work -from-home or work remotely is approved and signed off by the \nrelevant delegate, a copy of the signed application is to be provided to the employee as a \nrecord of the arrangement and agreed hours and days of the remote or HBW \n\u2022 employees must be contactable and available for communication with their workplace \nduring the period in which remote or HBW is carried out. \nAdditional factors for a remote work arrangement \n\u2022 Victoria Police issued IT equipment being transported to other locations must be conveyed \nby a Victoria Police employee or secure courier service for security purposes. Where a secure \ncourier service is utilised, this will incur additional costs. Employees  working interstate or \noverseas may pose significant risk to Victoria Police information if equipment is not \ntransported in line with protocols.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n30 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 New devices require initialisation through a secure connection from a Victoria Police \nlocation, this may not be achievable via remote laptop access in the first instance.  \n\u2022 The practicality of working hours may need to be thoroughly discussed and/or agreed \nbetween local management and the employee. This should consider the business needs of \nthe unit, contact hours required, and occupational health and safety risks. This is particularly \nimportant if the employee wishes to work from a location in a different time zone.  \n\u2022 Advice should be sought from Workplace Relations when considering a request for a \nremote work arrangement. \n6.7 Conditions \nCosts associated with a home-based-work location \n\u2022 Except for Victoria Police issued IT equipment, the employee is responsible for all costs \nassociated with establishing and maintaining their home-based-work location.  These costs \ninclude home and contents insurance, and modifications to comply with security and OH&S \nrequirements. \n\u2022 Any implications related to tax deductibility for a home-based-work location is a matter for \nemployees to pursue with the Australian Taxation Office. It is important for employees to \nkeep records of business and personal expenses and to seek accountancy advice \nconcerning any taxation requirements. \nCosts associated with a remote work location \n\u2022 Victoria Police may be responsible for the cost incurred for any directed travel from the \nemployee\u2019s designated remote work location (if there is a requ irement for \nintrastate/interstate travel as part of the employee\u2019s position description), including excess \ntravel, accommodation and meal expenses.  \n\u2022 As part of the remote working arrangement, the local area may nominate a number of trips \nper month/year for the employee to return to their usual place of work in Victoria, Victoria \nPolice may also be responsible for the costs associated with these trips.  \nTermination of a remote or home-based-work arrangement \n\u2022 A remote or HBW arrangement may, at any time, be altered or terminated at the request of \neither the employee or employer, after discussion and agreement between the parties. Any \nalteration or termination of a remote or HBW arrangement must be in writing.  \n\u2022 Termination of a remote work arrangement may incur relocation costs. \n\u2022 Employees can access dispute resolution as per the relevant clauses of the applicable \nenterprise agreement or as outlined under clause 14 of the Sworn Agreement or clause 10 \nof the VPS Ag reement if an agreement to work remotely or from home is refused or \nterminated. \n\u2022 Victoria Police\u2019s decision to approve a  remote or  HBW arrangement request may be \nrevoked with the provision of four weeks\u2019 written notice. Reasons for which a decision may \nbe revoked include but are not limited to: \n\u2212 changes to the employee\u2019s duties, responsibilities or home-based-work location such \nthat it is no longer possible for them to work-from-home or work remotely \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility \n  \n \n \n \n31 \n \n \n   \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2212 it becomes clear that the employee is not undertaking their required duties on the \ndays/or shifts they work-from-home and reasonable measures have been taken to \nresolve the performance issues \n\u2212 the employee does not comply with security or OH&S requirements \n\u2212 if the employee obtains a new position within the organisation, the home-based-work \narrangement will cease to exist, and if required, a new one negotiated with the new \nwork area. \n\u2022 Victoria Police\u2019s decision to approve a remote or HBW  arrangement request may b e \nrevoked immediately at the direction of the Assistant Commissioner, Professional Standards \nCommand or the Agency Security Advisor. Reasons for which a decision may be revoked \ninclude but are not limited to: \n\u2212 an unauthorised disclosure of information or a breach of security controls \n\u2212 a category 2 or 3 complaint or incident (Refer to VPMG Complaint management \nand investigations). \nRecording hours worked \nEmployees who undertake an approved remote or HBW  arrangement are expected to record \ntheir work hours for each fortnightly period on their timesheets, flexi -sheets or diaries as per \nusual work practice. \nChange to remote or home-based-work location \nIf an employee\u2019s remote or HBW  location changes from their original application, they must \nnotify their manager and complete a new application for approval by their manager.  \n6.8 Security controls \nPhysical controls \nIn accordance with VPMP Information use, handling and storage, the employee is to ensure \nthat:  \n\u2022 any Victoria Police information and equipment is always kept appropriately secure including \nwhen in use, in storage at home or in transit \n\u2022 the environment is physically protected and that there is no risk of \u201cshoulder surfing\u201d (i.e. \nno one can look over your shoulder). \nVictoria Police IT network access \nIf Victoria Police IT network access is required, this is to occur through approved secure two -\nfactor authentication (such as Connect.

This means the organisation and its employees are obliged to take steps \nto prevent discriminatory practices or behaviours, not just respond to issues or complaints of \ndiscrimination when they occur. \nTo meet this requirement:  \n\u2022 As an employer, Victoria Police main tains a workplace that values the diversity and \nindividuality of its employees and encourages a workplace that is inclusive, respectful and \nfair;  \n\u2022 As an employer, Victoria Police must exercise positive duty to accommodate reasonable \nworkplace adjustments s o that a person with disability can have equality of access, \nemployment and advancement opportunities (as per VPM Reasonable workplace \nadjustment); \n\u2022 All Victoria Police employees and others covered by this policy are expected to exercise \ntheir positive duty by preventing discriminatory practices and encourage behaviours that \ntreat others with dignity, courtesy and respect; and  \n\u2022 Policy owners must exercise positive duty by taking the necessary steps to eliminate barriers \nto equal opportunity when reviewing or developing systems, policy, training, infrastructure \nand equipment in their portfolio.  \nPositive duty refers to the duty of employers under Part 3 of the Equal Opportunity Act to take positive \naction to eliminate discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation. \n \nPolicy \nVictoria Police is committed  to providing flexible work options to assist employees to achieve an \nappropriate work/life balance, noting the dynamic nature of the policing environment and \nacknowledging not all types of flexibility will work for every role . As such Victoria Police provides its \nemployees with flexibility in working arrangements, where it can reasonably be accommodated, taking \ninto account the employee\u2019s family and carer responsibilities, disability, religion and culture. This applies \nto all LGBTIQ employees and family structures such as same sex coupled parents, single parents etc. \nWork unit managers are expected to consider and apply this policy when managing their workplaces. \nWorkplace flexibility represe nts cooperation and genuine commitment between employer and \nemployee for mutual benefit. Whilst not all forms of flexibility will be suitable for all roles at particular \ntimes or under particular circumstances  due to the nature of Victoria Police\u2019s busines s and having to \nmatch resourcing to demands , genuine consideration must be given to  the employee\u2019s needs  and \ncircumstances, alongside service delivery, rostering requirements, and corporate responsibility. This may \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n4 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nrequire additional discussion with the em ployee to reach agreement on an alternative proposal that \naccommodates the employee\u2019s circumstances and still meets the needs of the local unit. Victoria Police \nnotes that flexible work practices  also assist in attraction and retention and contribute to in creased \nproductivity and efficiency of employees. \nIn accordance with legislation and the principles of merit and equity, Victoria Police applies a standard \nof \u2018equitable\u2019, rather than a standard of the \u2018same\u2019. \n \n1.

Managers must  meet and discuss an application with the employee and \ngenuinely try to reach agreement on a change in working arrangements that will reasonably \naccommodate the employee\u2019s circumstances having regard to: \n\u2212 the needs of the employee arising from their circumstances \n\u2212 the consequences for the employee if changes in working arrangements are not made \n\u2212 any alternative flexibility arrangements that may meet the circumstances of the \nemployee that require flexibility \n\u2212 any reasonable business grounds for refusing the request. \n\u2022 Where an agreement is reached between the employer and employee on a change in \nworking arrangements that differs from that initially requested by the employee, the \nemployer must provide the employee with a written response to their request setting out \nthe agreed change(s) in working arrangements.   \n\u2022 An employee's request for a flexible arrangement may only be refused on reasonable \nbusiness grounds. Refer to the Checklist for assistance in consideration of business grounds. \nReasonable business grounds include, but are not limited to: \n\u2212 the new working arrangement requested by the employee would result in an \nunreasonable impact on the budget of the unit \n\u2212 there is no capacity to change the working arrangements of other employees to \naccommodate the new working arrangements requested by the employee \n\u2212 it would not be feasible to change the working arrangements of other employees, or \nrecruit new employees, to accommodate the new working arrangements requested by \nthe employee \n\u2212 the new working arrangements requested by the employee would be likely to result in \na significant loss in efficiency or productivity \n\u2212 the new working arrangements requested by the employee would be likely to have a \nsignificant negative impact on customer service. \n\u2022 Impact on service delivery, resources, and operational requirements will be key \nconsiderations in all applications , along with impact on the employee.  Local impact and \norganisational impact may also be considered including whether the workplace is no longer \nable to meet its minimum station profile  or rostering requirements, refer to CCI 01/24 \nMinimum station profiles and CCI 03/24 General duties rostering.   \n\u2022 Where an application cannot be accommodated on reasonable business grounds, \nmanagement should consider any other means by which the employee can be assisted, \nincluding temporary transfer, performing temporary duties in close proximity to the \nrequested work  location, alternative flexible rostering arrangements, shift variations as \ndeemed appropriate, or other welfare support. \n\u2022 Police members only \u2013 prior to approving an application from a probationary officer or \nRecruit, consideration must be given to the abo ve points and also to the impact on the \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n8 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nemployee\u2019s training program, to ensure that all mandatory training requirements are able \nto be completed in the requisite timeframes.  \n\u2022 Each application must be assessed on its merits and in light of the individual circumstances \nof the employee. \n1.6 Procedures and timeframes \n\u2022 Employees should submit their requests for flexible work arrangements in writing (using the \nrelevant form as specified in the policy section or the Flexible Arrangements Application \nForm, or where that is not possible, by email or general report VP form 47) to their local \nmanager as far in advance of the desired implementation of the requested change as \npossible to allow due consideration of the request. \n\u2022 Applications must include (see Checklist for further guidance): \n\u2212 details of the circumstances applicable to the request \n\u2212 an outline of the timeframe the circumstances will likely apply (where known) \n\u2212 supporting information or documentation to support the circumstances such as \nmedical reports, details of carer or parental responsibilities, and any other information \nthat will assist management consideration of the application, where necessary. \n\u2022 A written response to the request (including the particulars of the reasonable business \ngrounds if refusing an application) must be provided by their local management or the \nrelevant Delegate to the employee. \n\u2022 Where the request is a FWA, a written response must be provided within 21 calendar days \nof the manager receivin g their written application. This applies regardless of how an \nemployee submits their application, for example if an employee emails their manager with \ntheir request and then submits the application form at a later date to formalise the request, \nthe 21 day time period starts from the date of the email. \n\u2022 In consideration of the requirement to respond in writing within 21 calendar days, local \nmanagement must: \n\u2212 provide to the Delegate in a timely manner, copies of the application supporting \nevidence, and local management's assessment of the application \n\u2212 if appropriate, convene a meeting with the Delegate for the purpose of considering \nthe application, and/or employee to obtain further information in relation to the \napplication or to discuss the request, and/or alternative flexibility arrangements.  \n1.7 Duration of flexible working arrangement \nA request for a change in working arrangements will not be considered a permanent change in \nworking arrangements. A f lexible arrangement may be subject to review at any tim e e.g. if \noperational requirements or the employee\u2019s circumstances change . Such a review must  be \nconducted at least every 12 months, where practical to ensure the arrangement still meets the \nneeds of the employee and employer. Any review should be documented, and a copy retained \non the employee's file. \n1.8 Variations \n\u2022 An employee and their manager may seek to vary a flexible working arrangement as \nrequired.  Variations are subject to policy and legislative requirements.   \n\u2022 Variations to a flexible working arrangement must be done in consultation with the aim of \nmutual agreement with the employee or employees where two employees mutually rely on \na flexible working arrangement.  \n\u2022 Any variation to an employee\u2019s working arrangements should be documented and signed \nby both parties, and copies retained on the employee's file.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n9 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 For more details about documenting arrangements, refer to each of the relevant sections \nfor specific workplace flexibility arrangements or to specific policies (e.g. VPM Leave). \n1.9 Termination  \n\u2022 An employee or the delegate may terminate an IFA by: \n\u2212 giving no more than 28 days written notice to the other party in the arrangement; or \n\u2212 the delegate and employee agree in writing \u2013 at any time. \n\u2022 An employee or the delegate may terminate a FWA by: \n\u2212 providing written notice to the employee that the FWA cannot be continued based on \nreasonable business grounds; or \n\u2212 where the period of the FWA comes to an end. \n1.10 Recording of hours of work \nAll employees must complete, maintain and submit records of attendance in accordance with \nthe requirements outlined in the applicable enterprise agreement. \n1.11 Flexible working arrangements for employees returning from parental leave \n\u2022 To assist an employee in reconciling work and parental responsibilities, police members will \nbe entitled to choose the number of days they will work, which days of the week they will \nwork and which shifts they will work (in line with typically rostered shifts at their workplace) \nfor the first six weeks after they return to work.   \n\u2022 If a request for flexible working arrangement is granted (including by a full-time employee \nwho has taken parental leave to return to work on a part-time basis), this does not constitute \na permanent change to the employee\u2019s position with Victoria Police. \n\u2022 If a full -time employee who has returned from parental leave works on a part -time basis \npursuant to a flexible working arrangement, they are entitled to return to their substantive \nfull-time position once the flexible working arrangement ends, and the procedure set out \nin this policy will not apply.  \n \n1.12 Recording of decisions \nOnce a decision has been made in respect of a request for flexible working arrangements, a \ncopy of the application form, decision and reasons for it must be retained on the employee's \nfile. \nAny flexible arrangement must: \n\u2022 be in writing on the Flexible Arrangement Application Form \n\u2022 include the name of the employee and employer, and be signed by both \n\u2022 include details of: \n\u2212 the day on which the arrangement commences; \n\u2212 the date on which the arrangement finishes. \nand for an IFA: \n\u2212 the terms of employment (clauses of the relevant enterprise agreement) that will be \nvaried by the arrangement  \n\u2212 how the arrangement will vary the terms  \n\u2212 how the employee will be better off overall in relation to the terms and conditions of \ntheir employment as a result of the arrangement \n\u2212 how the IFA can be terminated. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n10 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nA copy of any IFA must be provided to the employee within 14 days after it is agreed to. \n1.13 Expression of interest transfer (police members only) \nWhere an employee has an existing flexible work arr angement and is successful in gaining a \ntransfer via the expression of interest process, their flexible work arrangement will transfer to \nand continue at the new work location unless it will result in significant negative impact on \nservice delivery, productivity or efficiency.  \n1.14 Dispute resolution \n\u2022 Where an application for a FWA (made under section 65 of the Fair Work Act or clause 10 \nof the VPS Agreement or clause 14 of the Sworn Agreement) has been refused, attempts \nshould be made to resolve the dispute at the workplace level. \n\u2022 An employee may choose to be represented at any stage by a representative, including \nunion representative.  \n\u2022 If a dispute is not settled with local resolution, or it is deemed inappropriate for the dispute \nto be discussed at the workpla ce level, employees (or their representatives) also have the \noption to use dispute resolution procedures outlined in the relevant enterprise agreement. \nThis includes the option of applying to the Fair Work Commission to have the dispute dealt \nwith by conciliation. \n\u2022 Alternatively, an employee may request a review of actions within 28 calendar days of \nnotification of the workplace flexibility outcome in accordance with VPM Review of actions \n(grievance).  If an employee elects to refer a matter to the Fair Work Commission then the \nmatter will be deemed out of scope of VPM Review of actions (grievance). \n2. Pregnancy in the workplace \n2.1 Overview \n\u2022 Victoria Police is committed to providing and maintaining a working environment for all \npregnant employees that is safe and without risks to health.  \n\u2022 So far as is reasonably practica l, pregnant employees will be provided with the option to \nundertake alternative duties where there is risk to the pregnant employee, their pregnancy, \ncolleagues and/or members of the public if they continue their usual role.    \n\u2022 Denying or limiting access to promotion, secondment, temporary duties, transfers or \ntraining on the basis of pregnancy, or potential pregnancy is discrimination and/or adverse \naction and employees must not be denied or limited access to these opportunities or to \nany other benefits connected with their employment.  \n2.2 Definitions \nRegistered Medical Practitioner: means a registered Doctor of Medicine and includes \nspecialists such as an Obstetrician.  \n2.3 Notification and risk assessment \nOnce pregnant, some aspects of an employee\u2019s role may pose risks to the employee and their \npregnancy. For this reason, pregnant employees are encouraged to notify their manager of their \npregnancy as soon as practicable, taking into consideration that some roles will pose higher \nhealth and safety risks to the employee and their pregnancy than others . An employee must \nprovide at least 10 weeks written notice of the intention to take parental leave, including the \nproposed start and end dates and the expected  due date . Notification should include a \nconfinement certificate from a Registered Medical Practitioner confirming the pre gnancy and \nexpected due date.   \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n11 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nThe manager is to ensure that the notification of pregnancy is treated confidentially and is \nrespectful of the pregnant employee.   \nEarly notification will ensure that a risk assessment can be conducted to determine appropriate \nduties during the pregnancy to avoid placing the pregnant employee or their pregnancy at risk.  \nAn occupational  health and safety risk assessment of the employee\u2019s duties should be \nconducted by the manager, in consultation with the employee, and will be based on advice from \nthe employee\u2019s Registered Medical Practitioner. This will enable an informed decision to be \nmade based on the Registered Medical Practitioner\u2019s advice  regarding appropri ate duties \nduring the pregnancy taking into consideration identified risks in the work environment . The \nemployee must provide the employer with a certificate from their Registered Medical \nPractitioner using the \u2018 Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019  \u2013 refer to \nVPM, \u201cHuman resource management , Flexible work arrangements, Practitioner Guides and \nResources\u201d. \nAny risk assessment must take into account the following:    \n\u2022 any potential risks to the health and safety of the pregnant employee and their pregnancy  \n\u2022 an OHS risk assessment of the work environment \n\u2022 the pregnant employee\u2019s preferences and circumstances including level of expertise \n\u2022 Operational Safety Tactics and Training (OSTT) requirements for operational duties \n\u2022 medical advice.   \nIt is the employee\u2019s responsibility to provide their Registered Medical Practitioner with a copy \nof the \u2018Pregnancy Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019 for them to complete.  \nIn consultation with their manager, an employee will be required to complete the \u2018Workplace \nSupport Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in Touch, and Return to Work from Parental Leave\u2019. The plan is \nintended to support employees and their managers through the process. \nFor further guidance on the workplace risk assessment and the \u2018Medical Information Pack and \nCertification Form\u2019 also refer to the \u2018Pregnancy in the Workplace and Return to Work after \nParental Leave Guide\u2019, this can be found on VPM, \u201cHuman resource management, Flexible work \narrangements, Practitioner Guides and Resources\u201d. \n2.4 Duties during pregnancy \n\u2022 Appropriate duties that have been determined, and as agreed between the manager and \nthe employee, must be recorded on the \u2018Workplace Support Plan: Pregnancy, Keep in \nTouch, and Return to Work from Parental Leave\u2019.  \n\u2022 If the work duties that have been agreed to, for the period of pregnancy, differ from the \nemployee\u2019s substantive position, the employee will continue to own and occupy their \nsubstantive position whilst performing the temporary duties. The employee will continue to \nreceive remuneration at their substantive rank/classification.  \n\u2022 Duties undertaken by a pregnant employee must be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure \nthat they do not expose the employee to unnecessary risk. This review might inform further \nchanges to the duties which can be safely perf ormed. The employee must notify their \nregistered medical practitioner and their manager of any developments in the pregnancy \nthat may present as a health risk so that appropriate adjustments to duties can be made.   \n\u2022 Refer to section 2.5 for information on transfer to a safe job. \nHigher duties \n\u2022 Where a pregnant employee is undertaking a higher duties assignment but, due to the \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n12 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \npregnancy cannot perform all of the duties of that assignment, and alternative duties or \nreasonable adjustments to work responsibilities at the higher rank/classification cannot be \naccommodated, the employee will no longer be eligible for the full higher duties allowance \nand will revert to their substantive position.  \n\u2022 For VPS employees, if the pregnant employee undertakes part of the duties of a higher \nclassified position, the level of the allowance shall be in proportion to the extent of the \nhigher duties being performed  (refer to VPM Remuneration for more information on \nhigher duties). \n\u2022 When considering the above, it should be remembe red that it is unlawful to discriminate \nbased on pregnancy. \nShift work \nFollowing the risk assessment the employee may be exempt from shift work or night shift where, \non the basis of the risk assessment (and/or advice from a Registered Medical Practitioner) it is \ndetermined that there are additional risks to the employee\u2019s safety during those shifts or where \na medical certificate accompanies the request.  \n \nOperational Safety and Tactics Training (OSTT)/Operational and Promotional Training \n\u2022 A decision regarding the completion of OSTT or other operational and promotional training \nduring pregnancy is one that the employee should only make following consideration of \nthe information provided in the \u2018Medical Information Pack and Certification Form\u2019, and must \nbe consistent with advice provided by their  medical practitioner. Pregnant employees \nwanting to undertake OSTT or other operational and promotion training must discuss the \nrisks associated with the training with their medical practitioner and o btain medical \nclearance to do so.   \n\u2022 For the avoidance of doubt, pregnant employees can be selected for promotions with a \nphysical component. This component may be completed upon the selectee\u2019s return to \noperational duties from parental leave. \n2.5 Entitlements during pregnancy \nDress for police members \n\u2022 Where the member\u2019s uniform can no longer be worn comfortably due to their pregnancy, \nthe member will be permitted to wear plain (professional) clothes.  \n\u2022 Pregnant members performing duties in plain clothes are entit led to receive a temporary \ncivilian clothing allowance. \nTransfer to a safe job  \n\u2022 Where an employee is pregnant and, in the opinion of a Registered Medical Practitioner, is \nfit for work, but it is inadvisable for them to continue at their present work because of illness \nor risks arising out of their pregnancy or hazards connected with the work assigned to the \nemployee, the employee will be transferred, if reasonably practicable, to an appropriate safe \njob for the risk period.    \n  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n13 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 The safe job may involve working from a different location or may mean modifying the \nemployee's existing role to remove any identified risks. This will depend on the result of the \nrisk assessment and opinion of the medical practitioner. \n\u2022 The safe job must involve meaningful  duties and be commensurate with the employee\u2019s \nskills, training and experience. This may include undertaking work from another work unit \nor the employee working from an alternative work location for a specific period or the \nduration of the pregnancy.  \n\u2022 The safe job will not alter the employee\u2019s terms and conditions of employment. The \nemployee will have the same ordinary hours of work as the employee\u2019s present position; or \na different number of ordinary hours as agreed by the employee and employer.   \n\u2022 Where an employee reduces their hours to better cope with their pregnancy, any paid \nparental leave subsequently taken will be paid at the rate of pay applicable prior the \nreduction in ordinary hours.  \n\u2022 If a transfer to an appropriate safe job is not reasonably pra cticable, the employee may \nelect, or the employer may require the employee to commence paid no safe job leave for \nsuch period as is certified necessary by a Registered Medical Practitioner or until the end of \nthe pregnancy. \n2.6 Leave \nLeave, including pre-natal leave and assisted reproductive leave, is granted in accordance with \nthe VPM Leave. \n3. Lactation breaks \n3.1 Principles \nVictoria Police is committed to fostering a supportive work environment for employees who \nchoose to breastfeed by: \n\u2022 providing appropriate workplace facilities for employees who choose to express breast milk \nor breastfeed their child \n\u2022 providing paid lactation breaks during work hours \n\u2022 ensuring all employees\u2019 awareness of breastfeeding policies and facilities \n\u2022 seeking to eliminate any unlawful direct and/or indirect discrimination on the grounds of \nbreastfeeding. \nEmployees who choose to breastfeed should be supported in that choice and treated with \ndignity and respect in the workplace. \n3.2 Definitions \nBreastfeeding: for the purpose of this policy, t his includes the physiological process of milk \nbeing produced to breastfeed or express breast milk for an infant or young child.  \nCaregiver: a caregiver is a person who assumes responsibility for bringing an infant or young \nchild onto Victoria Police premises with the intent of delivering the infant or young child to an \nemployee for the purpose of breastfeeding. \nLactation breaks: paid breaks taken by an employee in consultation with their employer for \nthe sole purpose of enabling an employee to express brea st milk or breastfeed an infant or \nyoung child off site or at the workplace. \nChild: generally refers to a child up to school age; however consideration should be given to \nemployee\u2019s individual circumstances and needs for breastfeeding a child. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n14 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n3.3 Breastfeeding facilities \n\u2022 Workplace facilities should be provided, where practical, for employees who choose to \nexpress breast milk or breastfeed their child during work hours. \n\u2022 Facilities should be accessible for all, in terms of space, location and security access.  \n\u2022 The minimum requirements for an appropriate workplace facility include, as far as  \npracticable: \n\u2212 a private, clean and hygienic space/room which is suitably signed and lockable \n\u2212 appropriate seating, a table or bench to support breastfeeding (and breastfeeding \nequipment) \n\u2212 suitable storage area for any equipment and/or electric breastfeeding equipment \n\u2212 a power point for breast pumps and other equipment \n\u2212 access in the workplace, to a refrigerator/freezer for storing milk and a microwave \n\u2212 access to a sink near the private space/room with hot water for washing hands and \nequipment \n\u2212 nappy change table \n\u2212 an appropriate receptacle for rubbish and nappy disposal.   \n\u2022 It is not appropriate for employees to breastfeed or express breast milk in toilet facilities, \nnor is it an appropriate location for equipment to be cleaned. Sinks and refrigeration located \nin a staffroom or kitchen facility should be used. Refer to the Au stralian Breastfeeding \nAssociation website for guidance on storage of expressed milk, if required.   \n\u2022 Generally, workplace facilities should be used, however consideration should be given to \nallowing the employee to go home, to a caregiver\u2019s home or accessing a childcare centre if \nrequested.  Requests should be assessed on a case by case basis. \n3.4 Lactation breaks \nThe frequency, duration and timing of lactation breaks: \n\u2022 should be determined through consultation between the employee and their manager to \nallow the flexibility needed to breastfeed or express milk. \n\u2022 will vary between individuals and may be influenced by factors including the child\u2019s age, \nfeeding habits, the location of the breastfeeding room and any special requirements.  \n\u2022 will likely reduce in frequency and increase in flexibility for scheduling around operational \nneeds over time . Police employees are entitled to up to one hour lactation break(s) per \neight hour shift, with these breaks being in addition to rest periods and meal breaks. The \none hour lactation break for each shift may be utilised through multiple short breaks if the \nemployee prefers.  VPS employees are entitled to reasonable time during working hours. \nThe employee\u2019s individual circumstances and needs should be taken into consideration. \n\u2022 should be discussed between the employee and their manager, using the Lactation Breaks \nPlan as a tool to facilitate these discussions, to ensure that they are taken at time that suits \nthe employee and the work unit. \n\u2022 should be timed where possible to consider reasonable business and organisational needs \nwith a focus on supporting employee health, while minimising disruption to the workplace \nand service delivery. If, in emergency situations, there is a need to delay the taking of a \nlactation break, efforts should be made to ensure that the employee is able to take the \nbreak as soon as practicable in order to mitigate any risks to the employee\u2019s health or milk \nsupply or the child\u2019s health. \n\u2022 the employee may return home or attend another location during the break as agreed with \ntheir manager. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n15 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 where the child or infant is breastfed offsite, the lactation break is inclusive of the time \nneeded to travel directly to and from the agreed location. Where this cannot be achieved \nwithin the break, alternate arrangements may be negotiated.   \n3.5 Responsibilities \nEmployees  \n\u2022 An employee intending to continue breastfeeding when returning to work should discuss \ntheir needs with their immediate manager prior to returning to work.   \n\u2022 The employee is responsible for:  \n\u2212 providing their own expressing and sterilising equipment and storage containers \n\u2212 ensuring that stored breast milk is properly secured, labelled and safely stored in a \nsealed receptacle \n\u2212 providing appropriate nappy change items should the infant or child be delivered to \nthe workplace \n\u2212 ensuring hygiene is maintained at all times, such as washing hands, hygienic disposal \nof nappies and rubbish, and leaving the workplace facility clean and tidy. \n\u2022 In addition, the employee is responsible for ensuring the caregiver: \n\u2212 is aware their access to the workplace is restricted to delivering the infant or young \nchild to the employee for the purpose of breastfeeding \n\u2212 vacates the workplace with the infant(s) and/or child at the completion of each \nbreastfeeding break \n\u2212 supervises the infant(s) and/or child at all times in the workplace. \nManagers  \n\u2022 The manager is responsible for:  \n\u2212 discussions occurring before an employee returns to work \n\u2212 ensuring the employee is not subjected to inappropriate behaviour or attitudes by \nother employees \n\u2212 ensuring appropriate facilities are available for lactation breaks \n\u2212 ensuring that decisions made regarding requests for lactation breaks are impartial, \ntransparent and capable of review \n\u2212 reviewing arrangements with the employee on a regular basis \n\u2212 where emergency situations result in a delay to scheduled lactation breaks, ensuring \nthat the employee can take their break as soon as possible to mitigate any health and \nsafety risks. \n\u2022 Where having considered all options, a manager anticipates that it will not be possible to \naccommodate lactation breaks, advice must be sought from Workplace Relations. \n4. Part-time Employment \n4.1 Objectives \n\u2022 All part-time work arrangements should take into consideration any relevant operational \nand service delivery requirements, rostering principles and the employee\u2019s individual \ncircumstances.  \n\u2022 Part-time employees will have the same opportunities as other employees in all aspects of \nemployment, including access to training , professional development, assignments and \npromotion.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n16 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n4.2 Definitions \nThe definitions outlined in section 1.2 of this policy apply to this section. \n4.3 Part-time employment \n\u2022 An employee may work on a part-time basis where the employee has been selected for a \npart-time position which was advertised (employer initiated), or the employee has applied \nand been approved to convert their existing position to part-time (employee initiated). \nEmployee initiated also applies  where a position has been advertised as full -time, but an \nemployee has elected to do this role on a part-time basis.  \n\u2022 Part-time positions can also be filled with the expression of interest transfer process, see \nsection 1.14. \n\u2022 This procedure does not apply to employees being rehabilitated under WorkCover ( see \nVPM Management and return to work of ill/injured employees) or where an employee \nworks on a part-time basis pursuant to a flexible working arrangement. \n\u2022 The ordinary hours of work must be contained  in a written agreement signed by the \nemployee and the employer and will include a set number of days or a set number of hours \nof work (or both) over an agreed period. \n4.4 Employer initiated: advertised part-time positions \nA part-time position may be advertised where there is a vacant part-time position, a new part-\ntime position has been created or a vacant position has been converted to part-time at the \nnomination of the employer.  \nEligibility  \nVPS Employees \n\u2022 All employees are eligible to apply for part-time employment.  \n\u2022 In addition, to assist a VPS employee in reconciling work and parental responsibilities, they \nmay request to return to work from parental leave at a reduced time -fraction until their \nchild reaches school age, after which they will have a right to resume their pre -parental \nleave substantive time-fraction.  \nPolice members \n\u2022 All members are eligible to apply for part-time employment subject to the below time in \nposition exceptions.  \n\u2022 Time in position requirements do not prevent a police member from applying for an \nadvertised part-time position except where:  \n\u2212 the member owns a special category or priority status position; or  \n\u2212 the new position involves the same hours of work as the member\u2019s current position \nand it would be the only position occupied by the member.  \n\u2022 Advertisements for part-time positions must specify the number of fortnightly hours and \nmay specify a proposed pattern of hours.  \n\u2022 An advertised part-time position must have identical qualifications to the full-time \nequivalent position, including OSTT.  \n\u2022 Appointment to an advertised part-time position is subject to the member and the \nemployer reaching agreement on a work pattern and completing  and submitting an  \n\u2018Application for a Part-time Arrangement/Application to Vary Existing Part-time \nArrangement\u2019 \u2013 apply through HR Assist, Employee Self Service, Status Change. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n17 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n4.5 Employee initiated: applications for and variations to part-time employment, or changes \nto ordinary rostering arrangements \nEligibility rules and procedures are set out in the Workplace Flexibility section.  \nWork pattern  \nPolice members \n\u2022 Any reduction from the standard hours of workplace must be at the initiation of the \nemployee. Ordinary hours of work for each rostered shift must be continuous. \n\u2022 Hours of work for part-time members can be structured different ways including:  \n\u2212 set start and finishing times on each day; and/or \n\u2212 a number of hours and days over a specified period. \n\u2022 Part-time arrangements should be in writing and provide for the set days or set hours of \nwork (or both) or an agreed number of hours and days to be worked flexibly. This means \nthat a process can be included in a part-time arrangement, which sets out parameters for \nany alteration to the pattern of the hours on a fortnightly basis . This is  with a view to \nmeeting the employee\u2019s work/life balance while taking into account the operational \nrequirements of the employer. Any such provision must be recorded in a written application \nfor a flexible work arrangement, or application to vary an existing flexible work \narrangement.  \n\u2022 The pattern of hours of a part-time member may vary from the standard roster at a work \narea only with the agreement of the employer.  \n\u2022 Where possible, shift lengths should be the same as the shift lengths at the station to which \nthe member is attached. However, a shorter or longer shift length can be agreed if it suits \nthe needs of the member and the workplace, the minimum shift duration is four hours.  \nVPS employees \n\u2022 Hours of work must include an agreed number of hours and days over a specified period. \n\u2022 Unless the employee is a shift worker, part-time hours of work must be rostered within the \nordinary span of hours of 7am to 7pm , Monday to Friday . An exception to this is if an \nemployee and their employer enter into an individual flexibility arrangement to meet the \ngenuine needs of both parties. Such an individual flexibility arrangement that includes hours \nof work outside of the ordinary span of hours must be in writing and signed by both the \nemployee and their employer  (the delegate for approval of the individual flexibility \narrangement is the Director, Recruitment, Deployment and Workplace Relations Division).  \n\u2022 Employees must not work less than three consecutive hours on a work ing day, except in \nexceptional circumstances by agreement with the employer.  \nVariations to part-time arrangements  \n\u2022 Workplace reviews can occur at any time, however it is advised that a review of the \nemployee\u2019s part-time arrangement should be conducted at least every 12 months, where \npractical, in order to assess whether the arrangement continues to meet the needs of both \nparties.  \n\u2022 If a VPS employee changes their work location, they will be required to submit a new part-\ntime application form through HR Assist, Employee Self Service, Status Change in order to \nhave their arrangement administratively carried over to the new location. A police employee \nwho changes work location will have their flexible working arrangement continue at the \nnew location unless it will result in significant loss of productivity or efficiency which is likely \nto have a negative impact on police service delivery. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n18 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 Any review of a part-time arrangement should have regard to the individual circumstances \nof the employee, including, where relevant, the childcare requirements of that employee. \nReviews of part-time arrangements must also take into account any requirements contained \nin the Fair Work Act, the Equal Opportunity Act and the criteria stipulated in the Workplace \nFlexibility section of this policy.   \n\u2022 Part-time working arrangements may be varied in writing between the employee and the \nemployer in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Workplace Flexibility section.  \nAny review should be documented and retained on the employee's file. \n\u2022 Temporary variations to agreed/rostered hours of duty of part-time employees may occur \nat any time following discussion and mutual agreement between the employee and the \nemployer.  \nPolice members \nWhere the employer proposes to vary an existing part-time arrangement that does not form \npart of a FWA and agreement cannot be reached, the employer may, upon the provision of six \nmonths\u2019 notice or a longer period as is reasonable having regard to the employee\u2019s personal \ncircumstances, vary the employee\u2019s pattern of hours.   \nDirected shift changes \n\u2022 Directed changes to shifts of part-time employees should only be considered in exceptional \noperational circumstances including when no other alternatives are available. The employer \nis to consider an employee\u2019s individual circumstances before directing a temporary change \nto the shifts of a part-time employee.  \n\u2022 Where a directed change has occurred, payments will apply in accordance with the \nenterprise agreements. \n\u2022 In certain circumstances where the employer has directed a change to an employee\u2019s shift, \nthe employer may be required to pay childcare  expenses. Childcare entitlements and \nexpenses apply as per the applicable enterprise agreement for VPS employees and police \nmembers. \nPolice members \n\u2022 Where the member\u2019s rostered shift is changed without the member\u2019s consent and 72 hours \nor less notice is given, the change of shift penalty will apply.  \n\u2022 Change of shift penalty is an additional amount of 25% of an employee\u2019s base hourly rate \nof pay for the duration of the changed shift. This penalty will not apply during a period \nwhere overtime is payable. \n\u2022 Part-time police members should not normally be required to be available for resumption \nof duty unless included in the \u2018Application for a Part-time Arrangement/Application to Vary \nExisting Part-time Arrangement\u2019 form. Where part-time members continue to be available \nfor resumption of duty, payment is to be made in accordance with the applicable enterprise \nagreement.  \nVPS employees \n\u2022 The employer may only direct a change where an emergency exists and there are no other \nalternatives.  \n\u2022 Overtime applies if the directed change is outside the normal span of hours of 7am to 7pm, \nMonday to Friday or the employee works more than 38 hours per week.  \nReturn to full-time employment \n\u2022 A part-time employee may revert to full-time employment at any time, providing that an \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n19 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nequivalent full-time vacancy or sufficient residual hours exist; however, t his is subject to \nsection 1.12 \u2013 Flexible working arrangements for employees returning from parental leave.   \n\u2022 Time in position requirements do not apply to either promotion or transfer to a full-time \nposition.  \n\u2022 An employee owning two part-time positions may make the request to convert to full-time \nin either of their existing positions, however if approved, would need to vacate their \nremaining part-time position as they cannot work more than full-time hours.  \n\u2022 Any requests are to be considered in the context of service delivery needs and are subject \nto availability of sufficient residual hours. At management discretion, hours available within \nthe Police Service Area, Division, Region, Command or Department, in which the employee \nis located may be utilised.  \n\u2022 Employees are not precluded from accepting different duties and/or a lesser \nrank/classification in order to return to full-time employment (this will mean being paid at \nthat rank/classification). \n4.6 Conditions of employment \nProvisions relating to salary, leave and all entitlements are outlined in the relevant enterprise \nagreement.  \nAllowances  \nPolice members  \n\u2022 Are entitled to pro rata amounts for the uniform and civilian clothing allowances and \ncommuted overtime allowance.  \nLeave  \n\u2022 Working part-time will impact the payment of long service leave - refer to the VPM Leave.   \n\u2022 Accrual of recreation and personal and carers leave will be on a pro-rata basis. \n\u2022 Police members who work part-time (including those who own/occupy multiple part-time \npositions) are not eligible for accrued time off.   \n\u2022 Prenatal leave is not impacted by working part-time. \nOvertime  \nAn employee may be required to work reasonable overtime in accordance with the provisions \nof the applicable enterprise agreements.  \nPolice Members \nOvertime will be paid for hours worked outside the ordinary hours specified in the member\u2019s \npart-time agreement at the rates contained in their enterprise agreement; or the member may \nelect to take time off in lieu under the enterprise agreement. This provision also applies for any \nattendance at training.    \nVPS employees \nOther than shift workers, additional hours up to and including 38 hours per week will be paid \nat the ordinary hourly rate of pay. Hours directed by the employer and in excess of 38 hours \nper week will be paid at the overtime rates specified in their enterprise agreement. \nAssignments and temporary duties  \n\u2022 Victoria Police\u2019s recruitment, allocation, assignment, transfer and promotion processes are \nconducted in a manner that provides fair and equitable opportunity to all employees. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n20 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 Part-time employees may be assigned to other positions or duties, either full-time or part-\ntime, in accordance with the assignment process. Part-time employees will have the same \nopportunity for higher duties, temporary duties and assignments as other full -time \nemployees. Refusing a part -time employee\u2019s application for these opportunities is \ndiscrimination. \n\u2022 Higher duties assignments may be share d by two part-time employees, if applicable. See \nVPM Remuneration for more details.  \n\u2022 Where the assignment is \u2018directed\u2019, the employee\u2019s existing working pattern remains unless \notherwise agreed.  \n\u2022 Where a part-time employee applies for an assignment with full-time or increased hours to \ntheir normal working pattern, if it is agreed that the part -time hours can be worked, the \nworking pattern arrangement for the higher duties or assignment period should be \ndocumented on the Employee Self Service, Status Change section of HR Assist.  \n\u2022 Where a part-time police member is assigned to a part-time position, or to a full-time \nposition on a part-time basis, they may, by request and with the agreement of the employer, \ncontinue to perform the duties of their own position while assigned to another position, as \nlong as their sum of rostered hours does not exceed 76 hours per fortnight. A part-time \nworking pattern agreement for the assignment position should be documented and signed \nby both parties.   \nSurplus employees \nIf a part-time position is abolished, the employee is declared surplus and is placed under the \nprovisions of 306-11 Redeployment (VPS) or VPM Mobility and redeployment ( police \nmembers). Where a part-time position is not available, surplus staff will be matched to \nappropriate full-time position in consultation with the employee. The employee may apply for \nthe position, to which they are matched, to be converted to part-time in accordance with section \n4.5 above.   \nSuperannuation \nPart-time employment has implications for superannuation. Employees should seek \nsuperannuation advice from their fund before finalising their part-time arrangements.  \nAttendance at training \nAlternative methods of delivery of training will be considered to maximise opportunities for all \nemployees to access training.    \n4.7 Owning/occupying two part-time positions \n\u2022 An employee may own/occupy two part-time positions at the same level/rank, and at the \nsame or different locations, provided that the sum of hours per fortnight does not exceed \n76 hours per fortnight. Employees who own/occupy two part-time positions must ensure \nthat the hours for each position are compatible. The member must communicate with each \nauthorised delegate separately concerning any changes that may impact on either position. \nThis includes the impact of attendance at training.    \n\u2022 When making decisions in relation to one of the positions the employee occupies, the \nauthorised delegate must consult with the authorised delegate of the other position \noccupied by the employee.  \n\u2022 Examples of the types of decisions that authorised delegates should consult over are:  \n\u2212 a direction to work overtime (to ensure that hours of both positions are taken into \nconsideration)  \n\u2212 approval of assignment or higher duties \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n21 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2212 the requirement to undertake compulsory training.     \nTime in position \u2013 police members \nWhen a police member occupies two part-time positions, time in position dates are the dates \nfor each individual position.  \nRate of pay \nThe employee shall receive salari es, entitlements and allowances, as provided by the relevant \nenterprise agreement, on a pro -rata basis for the total number of hours worked in both \npositions.  \nPromotion or reversion \u2013 police members \nWhen the member\u2019s rank changes (promotion or reversion) the member will be unattached \nfrom all positions at the previous rank.  \nWorkCover  \nWorkCover responsibilities are to be managed by the workplace in which the injury occurred. If \nit is not known when or where the injury occurred (e.g.: injury occurring over a period of time), \nthen the claim should be managed by the workplace where the employee was located when \nthe claim was lodged.  \nRelinquishing a position  \nThe employee may vacate one of the owned positions at any time in order to revert to owning \nonly one part-time position. Where this occurs for police members, the member must not apply \nfor an additional part-time position which involves the same hours as the relinquished position \nuntil the balance of the time in position requirements of the relinquished position have been \nmet.   \n4.8 Residual hours  \nManagement may consider using residual part -time hours to create and advertise additional \npart-time positions within their Police Service Area, Division, Region, Command or Department \nin order to fulfil the requirements of part of a role or fraction of unit. \nHowever, managers need to be mindful that surplus part-time hours (e.g. arising from requests \nby employees who have bee n on parental leave  to return to work on a part -time basis) are \nbeing managed appropriately . These hours must not be used to create new permanent \npositions that would prevent an employee on flexible arrangements from returning to full-time \nhours.  \nThe reason for this is t o assist an employee in reconciling work and parental responsibilities, \nemployees have the right to request to return to work at a reduced time-fraction until the child, \nor the youngest child, reaches school age, after which the employee will resume their \nsubstantive time-fraction or make application to work part-time as a flexible work arrangement, \nthis can be a permanent or temporary part-time arrangement.  \nDuring this time, the employee is on a temporary part-time agreement and the residual hours \n(FTE) either need to be quarantined or guaranteed to be restored on resumption of the \nemployee\u2019s pre parental leave hours (FTE).   \n5. Flexi-time (VPS employees only) \n5.1 Purpose \nVictoria Police is committed to providing flexibility in the workplace that takes into account the \nwork requirements of the organisation and the personal  and/or family circumstances of the \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n22 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nemployee.  \n5.2 Flexi-time \n\u2022 An employee can work and accumulate flexi-time by agreement between the employer and \nemployee: \n\u2212 where the manager is satisfied that there is sufficient work to be performed; and  \n\u2212 where required, a sufficient level of supervision is available.  \n\u2022 Flexi-time must be negotiated within the normal span of hours between 7:00am and \n7:00pm, Monday to Friday. Unless the employee and their manager have entered into an \nIFA, any work performed o utside of these hours is considered to be overtime. If  entering \ninto an IFA, contact Workplace Relations. \n\u2022 Flexi-time is to be taken at a time mutually agreed to between the employee and the \nmanager. \n\u2022 Flexi-time is not generally available to police members, shift workers, causal employees or \nVPSG-5 and above (and Forensic Officer equivalent), particularly those in management or \nsupervisory roles where business continuity would be adversely affected by flexi -time \narrangements. In exceptional circumstances howe ver, an individual arrangement may be \nreached between the parties.  \n\u2022 Where it is determined that the accrual of flexi-time no longer meets the needs of the work \nunit, the manager is required to consult with the relevant employees and the relevant union \nin accordance with the \u2018Implementation of change\u2019 provisions of the relevant enterprise \nagreement. \n5.3 Flexi-credit \n\u2022 Unless exceptional circumstances exist, and approval is provided by the manager to carry a \ngreater accrual, the maximum amount of flexi-time credit allowed for a full-time employee \nis 15.2 hours, and for a part-time employee is the equivalent of two days of their part-time \nwork pattern.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has flexi-time credit in excess of the allowable limit, the manager may \ndirect the employee to take the excess hours, unless the flexi -time credit is to cover a \nChristmas Closedown period in accordance with section 5.6 of this policy.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has flexi-time credit excess and exceptional circumstances exist, a level \n2 delegate may approve for outstanding credits to be paid out to the employee at their \nordinary hourly rate of pay. \n\u2022 Where an employee does not use all of their flexi -credit prior to the cessation of their \nemployment with Victoria Police, they will be entitled to have any outstanding credits paid \nout to them at their ordinary hourly rate of pay.  \n5.4 Flexi-debit \n\u2022 In exceptional circumstances, an employee may take flexi-time without the necessary flexi-\ncredit being accrued. This can only occur with prior approval from the manager and must \nnot result in a full-time employee having a negative balance that exceeds -7.6 (negative) \nhours for a full-time employee or that exceeds -1 (negative) day for a part-time employee. \n\u2022 If an employee has an excess flexi-debit and does not reduce the debit within a reasonable \nperiod as specified by the manager, the employee must elect to utilise either recreation \nleave or leave without pay to recoup the debit.  \n\u2022 Where an employee has a flexi-debit on cessation of employment, money or leave owed by \nthe employee to the employer will be debited accordingly, at their ordinary hourly rate of \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n23 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \npay in accordance with the Financial Management Act 1994 (Vic), except where the cessation \nis due to death.   \n5.5 Taking flexi-time \n\u2022 Flexi-time must only be taken with prior approval from the employee\u2019s manager. In making \nany assessment as to when flexi-time can be taken, the manager will give full consideration \nto the employee\u2019s preferences; however, it may not always be possible for the employee to \ntake flexi-time on their nominated day due to the service delivery requirements of the work \nunit.  \n\u2022 Flexi-time should be taken as a full or half day based on the employee\u2019s ordinary hours of \nwork. At the discretion of the manager, approval may be given to an employee to take flexi-\nleave in hours.  \n5.6 Christmas closedown \n\u2022 Where a work unit manager intends to closedown part or all of the unit\u2019s operations for the \nthree working days from the first working day after Christmas Day to the end of the last \nworking day before New Year\u2019s Day (1 January) (closedown period), the work unit manager: \n\u2212 will notify relevant employees in writing of this intention no later than 1 October of \nthe year in which the closedown is to take place \n\u2212 will request relevant employees to utilise any accrued time-in-lieu, annual leave, \nsubstitute leave, flexi-time credits or additional hours accrued under a flexible working \narrangement \n\u2212 may require a minimum level of staffing to meet the operational requirements of the \nworkplace. \n\u2022 If there are insufficient expressions of interest from relevant employees to give effect to the \nclosedown period, the following process will be applied: \n\u2212 the work unit manager may direct an employee who has excessive recreation leave \n(more than eight weeks or two years accruals), to take recreation leave during the \nclosedown period \n\u2212 the work unit manager may then direct an employee with accrued time-in-lieu, flexi-\ntime credits or substitute leave to take that leave during the closedown period. \n\u2022 The work unit manager will provide at least four weeks\u2019 notice of any direction to take leave. \n6. Working-from-home and working remotely \n6.1 Overview \nVictoria Police aims to provide employment options to maximise workforce flexibility and \npromote a balance between optimal service delivery and employees\u2019 personal commitments.  \n\u2022 Victoria Police will be fair and transparent in considering requests by employ ees to work \nremotely or work-from-home. \n\u2022 Employees granted approval to work remotely or from home will continue to be provided \nwith equal opportunities in their employment. \n\u2022 Individual working-from-home or remote work arrangements may be permitted on an ad-\nhoc or short-term basis or on a more regular basis in line with other flexible arrangement \nrequests and will be reviewed regularly, having regard to both employees\u2019 personal \nresponsibilities and organisational needs. \n\u2022 Employees are not to undertake remote of home-based work unless they have obtained \napproval in accordance with this policy. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n24 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 Where a State of Emergency or State of Disaster is declared, Victoria Police may issue other \nguidance which may supersede this policy in instances of differing information.   \n6.2 Definitions \nHome-based-work (HBW) location: the area designated by the employee within their home \nas the work location in which they will perform their home-based-work. This includes areas the \nemployee accesses in their home when taking breaks; such as the kitchen, bathroom, \npassageways and staircases. \nHome-based-work (HBW) arrangement: a flexible work arrangement that may be authorised \non a short-term basis to help accommodate employees\u2019 occasional and intermittent personal \ncommitments, and emergencies  or on a more regular basis to assist with an em ployee\u2019s \npersonal commitments and to help achieve an appropriate work/life balance.  \nRemote work: refers to a location that the employee has requested to work from that is not \nthe employee\u2019s home and may be an interstate or overseas location.   \nRemote work arrangement: a flexible arrangement that may be authorised, on a short -term \nbasis only, where the employee will be working from another location, other than their home, \nthat may be an interstate or overseas location.  \n6.3 Eligibility \nAll employees other than recruits, probationary constables and VPS employees who are within \ntheir probationary period are eligible to apply to work-from-home or work remotely . Any \nexception to this will only be considered in exceptional circumstances or as part of a reasonable \nworkplace adjustment for a current or prospective employee with disability. \nApplications for a remote work arrangement from an interstate or overseas location will be \nconsidered on a case by case basis only and several factors will need to be considered, including \nthe role performed and whether the role can be performed remotely or not. Relevant \nconsiderations are outlined throughout this section.  \n6.4 Information management & security \nPolicy adherence \n\u2022 All Authorised Users have a duty and responsibility to ens ure that Victoria Police \ninformation is protected from harm, unauthorised or inappropriate disclosure. \n\u2022 If Victoria Police employees have approval for a remote or HBW arrangement, they must \nensure that they continue to adhere to Victoria Police policy. This includes maintaining the \nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of Victoria Police information. \n\u2022 To ensure the security of Victoria Police information, Authorised Users who are not Victoria \nPolice employees are not to undertake work at home or remotely. \nRisks \nWorking-from-home increases the security risks for Victoria Police information including (but \nnot limited to): \n\u2022 the potential for people without a \u2018need -to-know\u2019 or without an appropriate security \nclearance to gain access to (or read) official information or other official resources \n\u2022 loss of Victoria Police information in transit between the workplace and home \n\u2022 viruses or other malicious code being present or being introduced to IT equipment.  \nRefer to the Protective Security Practice Guide \u2013 810 - Working from home securely for further \nguidance. \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n25 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nSecurity classified information \n\u2022 Information that has been assessed as PROTECTED or above is not to be worked on using \nhome-based or remote computer equipment, unless this is done on the Victoria P olice \nnetwork through approved secure two -factor authentication (such as Connect.Police \ntokens).  Refer t o VPM Information categorisation, collection and recording  for \ninformation on security classifications. \n\u2022 Hardcopy security classified information must b e stored in a container suitable for the \nclassification of the material when not in use. Refer to Protective Security guide \u2013 G200 \u2013 \nAssessment and handling of Victoria Police information. If a suitable security container is \nnot available, then the information should not be taken home. \n\u2022 Any deviation from these requirements requires approval by the Department Head after \nseeking advice from the Information Security Manager and the Protective Security Manager, \nInformation Security, Security and Management Services Division. \n6.5 Occupational health & safety \n\u2022 Victoria Police will provide and maintain, so far as is reasonably practical, workplaces and \nworking environments that are safe and without risks to health for all employees and \nindividuals using Victoria Police premises, facilities or equipment. This applies to an \napproved remote or HBW location. \n\u2022 Employees granted approval to work remotely or work-from-home must comply with their \nobligations under the Victorian Occupational Health and Safety Act  2004 and all relevant \nVictoria Police and WorkSafe occupational health and safety policies and procedures and \ntake corrective action to eliminate all potential hazards within their remote or HBW location.  \nAny hazards which cannot be immediately corrected must be reported.  \n\u2022 Employees will be required to comply with all reasonable and lawful directions by Victoria \nPolice from time to time, including directions regarding safe work methods which may \nrequire employees to rearrange or alter the remote or HBW location. \n\u2022 Employees must report all work related health and safety concerns or incidents that occur \nat their remote or HBW location to Victoria Police as soon as is reasonably practicable. \n\u2022 Where a WorkCover claim is accepted for an injury that occurred at a remote work location, \nconsideration must be given f or a return to work arrangement and how that could be \npractically implemented where the employee is working remotely (interstate or overseas). \nThis may incur additional costs.  \n6.6 Applying \nApplication form \n\u2022 Employees applying for a remote work or HBW arrangement must complete a Flexible \nArrangements Application Form  (including an OH&S Self -Assessment Checklist for their \nhome-based-work location) and submit it to their line manager for consideration.  \nConsultation between the employee and manager should occur and any reasonable \nworkplace adjustments required should be  discussed. Applications will be assessed on a \ncase by case basis and approval is at the discretion of management. \n\u2022 Accountability for con sidering remote or HBW applications remains with the approving \nlocation with final sign off required by Workplace Relations.  \n\u2022 Remote work arrangement applications must be approved by the Level 2 Delegate due to \nthe increased security risks and additional considerations associated with these requests. \nEmployee responsibilities \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n26 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nIn all cases where an employee submits a request for remote or HBW, consultation must occur \nbetween the employee and their manager as far in advance of the desired implementation of \nthe requested change as possible to allow due consideration of the request. It is the employee\u2019s \nresponsibility to ensure that:  \n\u2022 their manager receives their written request in a timely manner \n\u2022 they complete required forms and supply any supporting documentation for the application \nsuch as medical reports, details of carer or parental responsibilities, and any other \ninformation that will assist management consideration of the application \n\u2022 to provide their manager with sufficient information to reasonably consider their request \n\u2022 any changes in circumstances for the application are advised to their manager as soon as \npossible. \nManager responsibilities \nIn considering requests by employees to work-from-home or work remotely, the manager must \nconsider any relevant factors before providing the employee with a final decision. These may \ninclude: \n\u2022 compliance with all applicable legislation  (e.g. Equal Opportunity Act  and Disability \nDiscrimination Act and the Fair Work Act etc.)  \n\u2022 the nature of the responsibilities of the employee\u2019s position including supervision of other \nemployees, service response to other employees or the public, whether the employee \nrequires regular access to hard copy information and/or has access to sensitive or \nprotectively marked information \n\u2022 the nature of the employee\u2019s position and duties and whether any meetings, seminars, and \nconferences may be able to be facilitated remotely and/or online \n\u2022 whether the employee is fit for work , working-from-home is not a substitute for personal \nleave \n\u2022 whether the security risk of accessing Victoria Police information to enable an employee to \nwork remotely or work-from-home is too significant (refer to section 6.8 for more detailed \ninformation) \n\u2022 any security arrangements that an employee will need to comply with to enable a remote \nor home-based-work arrangement to be approved \n\u2022 whether the employee is in a position with specific liability considerations, for example legal \npositions. Remote work from an interstate or overseas location may have implications for \nthe individual\u2019s practicing certificate and/or Victoria Police\u2019s legal insurance.   \nIt should be noted that employees working from home or working remotely should not be \nconcurrently caring for a person/child while performing their work hours.  \nThe following will be considered in a remote or home-based-work application: \n\u2022 the ability of the employee to complete their remote or HBW within their ordinary hours of \nwork \n\u2022 the effect (if any) on the employee\u2019s work unit \n\u2022 the ability to successfully delegate work to an employee who is working -from-home or \nremotely \n\u2022 whether an employee who is working-from-home or remotely can be properly supervised \nand their work properly assessed (if an employee has requested to work remotely from a \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n27 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \nlocation with a different time zone, the practicality of communication and supervision needs \nto be considered) \n\u2022 an employee\u2019s ability to work autonomously i.e. an employee who requires close \nsupervision or constant interaction with other staff may not be suitable for the independent \nenvironment of remote or HBW with minimal supervision \n\u2022 details provided by the employee in their OH&S Self-Assessment Checklist \u2013 refer to VPM, \n\u201cHuman resource management, Flexible work arrangements, Practitioner Guides and \nResources\u201d  \n\u2022 evidence that the employee will be able to work in a room or area secluded from other \nparts of the home \n\u2022 equipment and resources necessary for the employee to effectively work -from-home or \nremotely. \n Additional factors for employees and managers \nAdditional factors for employees and managers to think about when considering applications \nfor a remote or HBW arrangement include: \n\u2022 appropriate security measures that must be applied to Victoria Police equipment and \ninformation when it is in transit to and from a remote or HBW location and being used, \nstored away or disposed of (refer to section 6.8 for more detailed information) \n\u2022 in accordance with VPMG Information and i nformation equipment disposal, any \nequipment (including personally owned equipment) that has been used to collect or store \nofficial information must be cleansed of all data or destroyed when:  \n\u2212 it has reached the end of its useful life  \n\u2212 prior to being sold or given to a third party. \n\u2022 for police members: \n\u2212 approved working-from-home arrangements should be in a proposed shift pattern as \nagreed between the employee and work unit manager, these should reflect the usual \nworking pattern of the employee and work unit. \n\u2022 for VPS employees: \n\u2212 if a VPS employee seeks to work outside their span of normal working hours, they will \nneed to negotiate an IFA with their management and formalised through consultation \nwith Workplace Relations. \n\u2022 if an application to work-from-home or work remotely is approved and signed off by the \nrelevant delegate, a copy of the signed application is to be provided to the employee as a \nrecord of the arrangement and agreed hours and days of the remote or HBW \n\u2022 employees must be contacta ble and available for communication with their workplace \nduring the period in which remote or HBW is carried out. \nAdditional factors for a remote work arrangement \n\u2022 Victoria Police issued IT equipment being transported to other locations must be conveyed \nby a Victoria Police employee or secure courier service for security purposes. Where a secure \ncourier service is utilised, this will incur additional costs. Employees working interstate or \noverseas may pose significant risk to Victoria Police information if e quipment is not \ntransported in line with protocols.  \n\u2022 New devices require initialisation through a secure connection from a Victoria Police \nlocation, this may not be achievable via remote laptop access in the first instance.  \n\n \nVictoria Police Manual  \n\u2013 Workplace flexibility  \n  \n \n \n28 \n \nOFFICIAL \nOFFICIAL \n\u2022 The practicality of working hou rs may need to be thoroughly discussed and/or agreed \nbetween local management and the employee. This should consider the business needs of \nthe unit, contact hours required, and occupational health and safety risks. This is particularly \nimportant if the employee wishes to work from a location in a different time zone.  \n\u2022 Advice should be sought from Workplace Relations when considering a request for a \nremote work arrangement. \n6.7 Conditions \nCosts associated with a home-based-work location \n\u2022 Except for Victoria Police issued IT equipment, the employee is responsible for all costs \nassociated with establishing and maintaining their home-based-work location.

      "summary": "# Key Changes: Victoria Police Workplace Flexibility Policy (2021-07 to 2022-07)\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nThe 2022 update to the Workplace Flexibility policy contains minimal substantive changes. The primary modification relates to **VPS employee return-to-work arrangements** following parental leave, with a clarification of flexible working options available to them.\n\n### Major Changes\n\n**1. VPS Return to Work from Parental Leave (Section 4.4)**\n- **OLD**: VPS employees could \"request to return to work from parental leave at a reduced time-fraction until their child reaches school age, after which they will have a right to resume their pre-parental leave substantive time-fraction.\"\n- **NEW**: Same provision retained, but the policy context was updated to reflect \"changes to VPS return to work requirements\" (per the update history).\n\n**2. Policy Context Statement (Policy Section)**\n- **OLD**: Referenced \"the Victorian Government's commitment embedding flexible work in the Victorian Public Service with the starting point that all roles can have some type of flexibility\" and included specific reference to \"the three day a week default in a primary work location for full time employees.\"\n- **NEW**: Removed the explicit reference to the three-day-per-week default and VPS-specific guidance. The policy now states: \"noting the dynamic nature of the policing environment and acknowledging not all types of flexibility will work for every role.\"\n- This reflects the shift away from prescriptive VPS defaults toward more flexible, case-by-case assessment.\n\n**3. Section 6.3 Eligibility (Working from Home/Remote Work)**\n- **NEW**: Added reference to \"VPS Employees \u2013 Flexible Working Arrangements Guideline\" noting that full-time VPS employees have \"a starting point for conversations around working from home or working remotely as three days a week...from their primary work location...This is not compulsory and individual arrangements may vary.\"\n- This provision was moved from the main policy text to a supporting guideline, making it advisory rather than prescriptive.\n\n**4. Section 6.6 Application Form Language**\n- **OLD**: Referred to \"Application for Home-based-work\"\n- **NEW**: Updated reference to \"Flexible Arrangements Application Form\" to align with broader application processes.\n\n### What Changed Minimally or Not at All\n\n- All core eligibility criteria, procedures, timeframes, and decision-making frameworks remain unchanged\n- Accountabilities, dispute resolution processes, and documentation requirements are identical\n- Part-time employment provisions, flexi-time rules, and pregnancy/lactation break provisions are substantively unchanged\n- Security controls and OH&S requirements for remote/home-based work remain the same\n\n### Removed Content\n\n- The explicit mention of \"the whole of Victorian government Flexible Work Policy\" in the main policy text was removed, though references to the \"VPS Employees \u2013 Flexible Working Arrangements Guideline\" suggest this framework is still referenced\n- Removed prescriptive language about the \"three day a week default\" from the core policy, relegating it to guidance documents\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is a **minor update** focused primarily on **clarifying VPS flexible working arrangements** and reducing prescriptive language about working location defaults. The update reflects a shift toward **greater individualization** of flexible arrangements for VPS employees rather than applying a blanket three-day-per-week rule. All substantive procedural and eligibility provisions remain materially the same.",

      "summary": "# Summary of Key Changes: Victoria Police Workplace Flexibility Policy\n\n## Major Policy Changes\n\n### 1. **Fair Work Act Updates (Section 1.5)**\n- **New eligibility ground added**: \"Is pregnant\" is now explicitly listed as a protected circumstance for requesting flexible working arrangements under the Fair Work Act\n- Updated legislative framework now references Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs Better Pay) Act 2022\n\n### 2. **Operational and Station Requirements (Section 1.5)**\n- **New consideration**: Flexible work applications must now consider:\n  - **Minimum station profiles** (reference to CCI 01/24)\n  - **General duties rostering requirements** (reference to CCI 03/24)\n- Impact on service delivery now explicitly includes whether the workplace can meet minimum station profile or rostering requirements\n\n### 3. **Lactation Breaks - Significant Removal (Section 3.4)**\n- **Removed requirement**: The mandatory \"Lactation Breaks Plan\" documentation is no longer required\n- **Removed from flexibility table**: Lactation breaks no longer listed as a formal \"type of workplace flexibility\" in the options table (Section 1.4)\n- **Process simplified**: Breaks are now to be \"discussed between the employee and their manager, using the Lactation Breaks Plan as a tool\" rather than as a formal requirement\n\n### 4. **Pregnancy - Added Protected Circumstance**\n- Pregnancy is now explicitly recognized as grounds for requesting flexible working arrangements (in addition to existing parental/carer responsibilities)\n\n## Minor Clarifications and Refinements\n\n### 1. **Definitions and Procedures (Section 1.6)**\n- Reference to \"Code of Conduct \u2013 Professional and Ethical Standards\" updated in opening statement\n\n### 2. **Manager Responsibilities Enhanced (Section 6.6)**\n- Manager responsibilities section expanded with more detailed guidance on considerations\n\n### 3. **Updated Cross-References**\n- Multiple references updated to newer CCI directives (CCI 01/24 and CCI 03/24) reflecting current operational guidance on station profiles and rostering\n\n## What Stayed the Same\n\n- Core eligibility requirements and 21-day response timeframe\n- Part-time employment procedures and conditions\n- Flexi-time provisions for VPS employees\n- Working-from-home and remote work security requirements\n- All pregnancy support provisions remain intact\n- Parental leave return-to-work arrangements unchanged\n\n## Policy Intent Changes\n\nThe updates reflect a stronger operational focus by:\n1. Explicitly linking flexible work requests to operational capacity (station profiles and rostering)\n2. Recognizing pregnancy as a standalone protected circumstance (not just as parental-related)\n3. Simplifying lactation break administration while maintaining support for breastfeeding employees",
